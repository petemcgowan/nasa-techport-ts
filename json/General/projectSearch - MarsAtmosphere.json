      "description": "The central objective of this study is to develop a model of heat transfer to a hypersonic vehicle entering the Martian atmosphere. During the 1950s and 1960s, radiative heating was studied to ensure safe reentry into Earth&#x27;s atmosphere from the Moon. During the hypersonic stages of reentry, an ion layer forms around the capsule. In Earth&#x27;s atmosphere, this ion layer is made up of O2 and N2 plasma. As NASA&#x27;s attention is turned to the human exploration of Mars, the radiative heating process that occurs during entry descent and landing (EDL) is significantly different than Earth EDL as studied during the time of the Apollo Program. These differences arise primarily due to the differences between Earth and Mars&#x27; atmospheric composition, which results in different ion layers that form around the entry vehicle. The Laser Spectroscopy and Gas Dynamics Laboratory at UCLA houses a newly built shock tube. The shock tube will be filled with different gasses found on Mars (for example CO2, CO, Ar), and ultimately with a simulated Martian atmosphere (including trace amounts of other gasses in their respective ratios on Mars). The shock tube will generate a moving shock that travels down the tube through the test section and reflects off of the wall. This shock reflection generates high temperatures, and this is where the heat transfer properties of the gas mixture can be observed. The region of high temperature gas will be probed using laser spectroscopy and the data collected will be used to create a thermodynamic non-equilibrium kinetic model that will capture the rates of energy transfer. A NASA shock tube study in 1996 conducted by Whiting et al. predicts carbon monoxide to be contributing around 65% of the total heat transferred to an entry vehicle during a Mars descent. They used laser emission spectroscopy, and we propose using laser absorption spectroscopy. Absorption spectroscopy done in the mid-infrared wavelengths will allow us to probe the evolution of rotational and vibrational state populations (or rotational and vibrational temperatures) of these CO and CO2 molecules behind reflected shock waves in a simulated Martian atmosphere. Once the rates of energy transfer between translation, rotation, and vibration are known for different molecules in this environment, a model will be built. This experiment will increase the fundamental understanding of radiative heat transfer to probes in different chemically active flow fields. An increase in the fundamental understanding of radiative heat transfer is vital to NASA as they send landers and eventually humans to planets and moons with different atmospheric composition. This research would directly aid both the large and small payloads bound for Mars in the future by increasing our understanding of the heat transferred to the entry vehicle during descent through the atmosphere. By increasing our knowledge of atmospheric entry and descent, NASA will be able to create more efficient thermal protection systems (TPS) for entry vehicles, reducing the mass of the TPS. This will allow more payload mass to be delivered to the surface of Mars. Understanding the fundamental physics of this problem will also allow for safer payload descent and less environmental contamination as many groups from across the globe aspire to land drones and rovers on Mars.",

      "description": "The Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE) will be the first in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) technology demonstration on Mars. Competitively selected in 2014, MOXIE will fly on the Mars 2020 rover in 2020, to land on Mars in 2021. Sponsored by HEOMD and the Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD), MOXIE will utilize solid oxide electrolysis to process Mars&#x19; CO2 atmosphere to produce O2. MOXIE will be a critical first step in long-duration mission architectures that would require use of local resources to reduce risk and control cost. By partnering with Science Mission Directorate on the Mars 2020 mission, human exploration leverages existing investments in the Mars program while advancing a key technology for NASA. Experiment objectives are to intermittently operate an oxygen production plant on Mars across a range of diurnal conditions during the primary mission year and producing at least 6 grams of O2 per hour with 99.6% purity. The technology will demonstrate resilience with respect to dust and other environmental challenges and will return performance parameter data that are critical to the design of a full-scale system. MOXIE consists of a CO2 acquisition system (a scroll pump) and a solid oxide electrolysis (SOXE) system to process the atmosphere producing O2. O2 will be processed on a batch basis as rover resources allow but of sufficient amounts to test system resiliency. By monitoring the production rate, power usage, and other performance characteristics of the system, MOXIE will provide an assessment of the prospects for extension to a full-scale system in support of a human mission. Mars atmosphere enters the system through an inlet valve and dust is filtered out. A scroll pump delivers up to 50 g/hour of atmosphere to the SOXE subsystem. The Mars atmosphere is processed as follows: the SOXE is warmed to 800 C; the pump is started and the filtered air will flow continuously at &gt;1 torr to the SOXE. The O2 and CO are separated and the flow rate is measured. The O2 and CO are vented out the side of the rover.",

      "description": "Entry, descent, and landing (EDL) systems are a key component of the technologies required to support NASA&#x19;s mission to &#x1c;enable human expansion across the solar system.&#x1d; Aeroassist technologies, specifically aerocapture and direct atmospheric entry, offer a promising advancement in the current state of the art for EDL at planetary-sized bodies with an atmosphere. Aerocapture is the use of a body&#x19;s atmosphere to slow down a spacecraft and convert the hyperbolic arrival trajectory to a desired elliptical orbit around the body. Direct atmospheric entry also uses the body&#x19;s atmosphere to slow down, then continues to monotonically descend through the atmosphere until final landing. Aerocapture Drop-Off is an original and innovative concept which I will investigate that combines aerocapture of a primary payload with direct atmospheric entry for a secondary lander. This concept could offer more flexible, lower-cost access to the surface of Mars, Titan, or Venus. The concept has a variety of potential applications, including Mars Sample Return and taking advantage of smallsat innovations to distribute small landers on the Martian surface with any given orbiter. The concept could also be applied to human spaceflight missions. I propose a two-part investigation of this idea. The first phase focuses on feasibility assessment and conceptual design, relying on tools like CBAERO and GMAT for conceptual design and simulation. The second phase involves a more in-depth study of the flight mechanics involved, which will make use of Monte Carlo simulations for uncertainty analysis and hardware-in-the-loop testing of control algorithms.",

Additionally MOXIE will provide insight into the atmospheric dust characteristics to understand its effects on the operation of surface systems. MOXIE collects CO2 from the Martian atmosphere and electrochemically splits the CO2 molecules into O2 and CO.

      "description": "The evacuated airship or vacuum airship is a concept for a lighter than air flight vehicle which obtains a reduced effective density by holding a sustained vacuum within a rigid structure. Buoyancy in air is attained by creating a large enough structure to displace a mass of atmosphere greater than the mass of the structure which is needed to support the load of atmospheric pressure. Such a vehicle has greater possible lift than traditional methods as well as no reliance on a lifting gas to provide the buoyancy. Much as a boat floats on water, replacing water displaced by a rigid structure with air, a vacuum airship replaces the atmosphere with empty space using a rigid structure. The main impediment to construction of the evacuated airship is the structure, which must be strong enough to support atmospheric pressure while having less mass than the volume of atmosphere displaced. Therefore, this project aims to overcome the aforementioned difficulty by implementing current advancements in materials and design methods as well as development of new design methods for further improvement. Additionally, these theoretical design tools and analysis will be testing for verification of the theory and models, providing greater certainty in the design and appropriate margins. The final goal of the project is a verified structural design for a viable vacuum airship for Mars.",

      "description": "We propose development of a device that will directly measure both the electrical charge and the mass of atmospheric dust particles on Mars. Such measurements have never before been made on Mars, but are critical to understanding the possible effects of dust on human Mars activities and in situ resource utilization. These measurements will also inform models of weathering and atmospheric effects on Mars. The device consists of an array of image charge detectors made using printed circuit boards. Particle charge is measured directly for each grain that enters the instrument. Mass is determined by electrostatically slowing the particle in a region between two detection arrays. The proposed effort seeks to develop this device from TRL 2 to TRL 3, including testing with charged Mars dust simulant. The proposal includes development of a low-noise amplifier that greatly exceeds the performance of the heritage Amptek amplifier. Science goals of the proposed device include measurement of the electrical charge and mass of a large number of individual dust grains that are blown through the instrument. It will also be possible to include a pump or blower and force particle-laden air through the instrument. The proposed research is directly relevant to Mars exploration and science. Electrostatic adhesion of dust is expected to be an issue in human exploration of Mars (sticking to astronaut suits as occurred during lunar surface missions, possible respiratory effects, etc.) and also to mechanical operations such as ISRU processing of the Martian atmosphere to produce oxygen. Prior measurements constrained general size distributions via optical scattering, but neither charge nor mass has been directly measured. Further, no instruments have been selected on any upcoming Mars missions (ExoMars, Mars2020, InSight) that are able to make these measurements. Thus the proposed work directly advances our understanding of the dust properties and processes on Mars. Further, the proposed effort falls best into the PICASSO program because if the TRL level development, the fact that this is instrument development, and the planetary-specific targets for the instrument type.",

      "description": "The atmosphere of Mars is predominantly carbon dioxide (95.5 percent), with nitrogen, argon, and trace gases comprising the remaining portion. KSC and GRC are developing a cryofreezer and a temperature swing absorption pump, respectively, for CO2 collection. The cryofreezer freezes CO2 selectively out of the Mars atmosphere onto a cold head which is then heated to vaporize the CO2 resulting in a chamber of high pressure CO2 that can be provided to downstream oxygen or fuel processing. In the temperature swing adsorption pump, Mars atmosphere is pushed through a sorbent material that preferentially adsorbs carbon dioxide at low temperatures. Once the adsorbent material is saturated, the material is heated to release the carbon dioxide at higher pressure. Thermal and fluid analyses are being applied to investigate the best combination of cycle time, number of stages, adsorption/desorption temperatures, sorption material, and stage size. To prevent dust ingested from the Mars atmosphere from degrading the performance of the CO2 collection system, a scroll media filter and an electrostatic precipitator are also being developed. A scroll filter system is based on a design of a filter system developed for life support systems to clean particulates out of spacecraft cabin air. This filter will be tested and characterized in the Mars Flow Loop facility at Glenn Research Center (GRC). Electrostatic precipitators use a high voltage corona discharge to charge aerosolized particles which are deposited on collector electrodes as a result of electrostatic forces. Tests are being conducted at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) to determine the effects of length, diameter, inlet velocity, and applied voltage on dust removal efficiency. Carbon Dioxide Collection, Separation, and Pressurization is part of the AES In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) Technology Project which is developing the component, subsystem, and system technology to enable production of mission consumables from regolith and atmospheric resources at a variety of destinations for future human exploration missions. The overall goals of the ISRU Technology project are to achieve system-level TRL 6 to support future flight demonstration missions and provide exploration architecture teams with validated, high-fidelity answers for mass, power, and volume of ISRU systems. The project&#x27;s initial focus is on critical technology gap closure and component development in a relevant environment (TRL 5) for Resource Acquisition (excavation, drilling, atmosphere collection, and preparation/beneficiation before processing) and Resource Processing &amp; Consumable Production (extraction and processing of resources into products with immediate use as propellants, life support gases, fuel cell reactants, and feedstock for construction and manufacturing). The interim project goal is to complete ISRU subsystem tests in a relevant environment to advance the subsystem to TRL 6. The project end goals are to perform end-to-end ISRU system tests in a relevant environment (system TRL 6) and integrated ISRU-exploration elements demonstrations in a relevant environment. ISRU is a disruptive capability that enables more affordable exploration than today&#x19;s paradigm where all supplies are brought from Earth, and allows more sustainable architectures to be developed. The availability of ISRU technologies can radically change the mission architecture and be the sizing design driver for other complex systems already in development. For example, the current Mars architecture assumes ISRU production of up to 30 metric tons of propellant on the Mars surface in order to reduce the ascent vehicle landed mass by 75 percent and reduce Earth launch needs by at least 300 metric tons. If a decision was made to use storable propellants for the Mars ascent vehicle instead of ISRU-producible oxygen and methane, many other drastic changes to the architecture could be required, such as lander and ascent vehicle size, number of landers needed, surface operations for ascent vehicle fueling, and Mars rendezvous orbit. Other surface systems might become more complex or heavier if they are not designed to take full advantage of ISRU technologies. Examples include a more complex closed-loop life support system if resupply with ISRU water cannot be assumed, or a heavy, built-in habitat radiation shield if a water- or regolith-based shield cannot be added after habitat delivery to the surface. Other system designers may also make decisions that reduce the benefit of incorporating ISRU into the mission, resulting in a larger or more inefficient ISRU system. For example, a non-continuous power source such as solar power would increase the required production rate and peak power of an ISRU plant, thus increasing its size and complexity due to hundreds of start-stop cycles. However, a continuous power source, such as nuclear or solar power with storage, would allow an ISRU plant to operate continuously, thus minimizing its size, complexity, and power draw. These are only a few examples of how the inclusion of ISRU has ripple effects across many other exploration elements. ISRU is also a new capability that has never before been demonstrated in space or on another extraterrestrial body. Every other exploration system or element, such as power, propulsion, habitats, landers, life support, rovers, etc., have some form of flight heritage, although almost all still need technology development to achieve the objectives of future missions. This is another critical reason why ISRU technology development, leading to a flight demonstration mission, needs to be started now, so that flight demonstration results can be obtained early enough to ensure that lessons learned can be incorporated into the final design.",

      "description": "Physical Sciences Inc. and Purdue University propose to develop a novel approach to scavenging heat from high intensity thermal environments encountered during space missions and converting this thermal power to electrical power at high efficiency. Examples include extremely hot heat shields during vehicle entry into planetary atmospheres (Mars/Venus probes) and during high speed ascent through planetary atmospheres (Sample return from Mars/Venus), hot claddings of radioisotope thermoelectric generators used for powering outer planetary spacecraft and multi-decade planetary bases (Mars/Venus/Lunar), as well as combustors/nozzles of space and launch propulsion systems, specifically, nuclear propulsion systems of renewed interest. The technology is also applicable commercially to high temperature sources encountered in terrestrial systems, such as portable electrical power converters from machinery (engines, stoves) used by soldiers and civilians in outdoor environments, In this STTR we will develop an integrated metal hydride (MH) system and spectrally-tuned thermophotovoltaic power converter (PC) system that can extract heat during periods of high thermal intensity and convert it to electricity at greater than 25 percent efficiency. The MH system provides the high temperature reservoir needed for PC operation. In Phase I, for the PC system, we demonstrated feasibility of fabricating a critical emitter component in larger areas (5 cm x 5 cm), and for the metal hydride (MH) system, we experimentally characterized the MH decomposition reactions. In Phase II, we will produce and functionally characterize an integrated engineering prototype of the MH-PC heat scavenging electrical power generator system, fully tested in the laboratory and in simulated thermal-vacuum environments, together with an analytical model of the functional system. We will identify candidate facilities (e.g., NASA/Stennis) for field testing of the system in Phase III.",

      "description": "In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) is the identification, collection, processing, and use of local materials to support space missions. It is a concept that has been growing in momentum with humanity&#x27;s push towards developing a space economy and enabling space exploration. Resources derived from ISRU can be used for life support, construction, propulsion, and energy for both manned and unmanned missions. It has significant potential to reduce the mass, cost, and risk associated with spaceflight. Instead of launching large amounts of consumable materials, space systems can employ ISRU to obtain these materials at the destination site. An example of an in-situ resource is the atmosphere of Mars, which is composed of 96% carbon dioxide. This can be converted into other useful chemicals with appropriate ISRU equipment. The Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE) is an instrument that seeks to turn the atmospheric carbon dioxide on Mars into oxygen for propellant and life support. MOXIE is a payload being developed for NASA&#x27;s 2020 Mars Rover, and will produce oxygen from the Martian atmosphere through solid oxide electrolysis (SOXE). The objective of MOXIE is to produce greater than 99.6% purity oxygen at a rate of 10 g/hr (&quot;MOXIE - Mars 2020 Rover,&quot; 2016). It is a roughly 0.5% scaled version of a unit that could produce enough oxygen to fuel a Mars ascent vehicle for a future manned mission to the planet. In addition to providing the oxidizer for an ascent vehicle, a scaled version of MOXIE would be able to produce oxygen for breathability, habitation pressure, and ground vehicle propulsion. MOXIE will be the first oxygen-production plant of its kind to travel to another celestial body. As such, it presents a unique opportunity to test ISRU technologies off the Earth. This proposed research studies MOXIE from a modeling and hardware development perspective. The first step will be to improve the software model of MOXIE currently in development at MIT. This will include the incorporation of SOXE data and chemical engineering into the model. The second step will be to compare the performance of an engineering model with the predicted performance of the software model. Physical testing will be conducted with the engineering model at MIT for this purpose. The third step will be to conduct research into potential scale-up and extensibility of the system. The overall goal of this research will be to develop a highly accurate model that NASA can use to map ISRU capabilities for future human exploration missions. The modeling and extensibility research described here are not a part of current NASA or JPL work, which is why this proposal is being submitted for funding consideration. The proposed research on developing accurate models for ISRU technologies like MOXIE is beneficial to NASA on several levels. From a values standpoint, the goal of this research aligns very closely with NASA&#x27;s core mission and vision to &quot;pioneer the future in space exploration&quot;. Along the same lines, this proposal indicates that the Science and Technology Mission Directorate is particularly interested in attracting researchers who are &quot;working on high-priority technologies to sustainably explore space.&quot; This research directly contributes to the sustainability of space exploration by demonstrating the extensibility of in-situ production of oxygen on other celestial bodies. Significant public interest is expected when it is announced that NASA has demonstrated the ability to produce oxygen on the surface of Mars using local Mars resources. At that point, it will be important to understand the extensibility of the system. In addition, by developing technologies like MOXIE that enhance our ability to send humans to Mars and bring them back, our nation will maintain its competitive position as a leader in the international marketplace.",

      "description": "Several successful missions have previously traveled to Mars and been very useful for furthering human understanding of the planet. However, missions in the future will require larger landed masses and decreased uncertainties, especially if a manned mission is being attempted. Therefore, improving current computational tools will be important for meeting these requirements. One event of interest that occurs on Mars is the formation of planet encircling dust storms; these storms sweep dust high into the atmosphere, which could interfere with an entering vehicle&#x19;s heat shield. The reasons for the formation of these storms is not well understood, so it not realistic to predict when they will occur and therefore it is vital to characterize how these particles interact with an entry vehicle. Due to the complicated aerothermodynamic nature of the hypersonic flow field, it is challenging to understand the effect these particles will have. Experiments have been performed to investigate these effects; although they show that the addition of particles causes an increase in both heat flux and mass loss of the thermal protection system material, they cannot recreate many of the conditions that are present for a realistic Martian entry. Based on this, it would be desirable to have numerical models that help in the understanding of particle laden hypersonic flows. The goal of the proposed research is to investigate some of these interactions between the particle and the flow field and to model these effects in a way that is useful for current computational tools. As a first step, interactions between the particle and the flow field that are not currently accounted for will be investigated to determine their importance. Based on the small particle size, a useful tool for analysis is this stage is the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) method. Some of the effects to be considered are particle-shock interactions, particle drag and heat transfer models, phase change of heated particles, and particle interactions with fibrous thermal protection system materials. Then, the effects that are deemed to have a non-negligible impact need to be modeled. Finally, the new models will need to be added to existing computational flid dynamics (CFD) tools. These tools can then be used to more accurately determine the effect atmospheric particulates have.",

      "description": "We propose to build a new kind of in situ radar for short-range mapping of near-surface atmospheric water vapor on Mars. Dubbed WASSR (WAter Sounding Short-range Radar), the instrument features a highly compact and low-power differential absorption radar that operates near the 557 GHz water absorption line to measure absolute humidity along its beam path with as good as few-ppm accuracy. WASSR takes advantage of a unique and fortuitous condition in the Martian atmosphere wherein water vapor exhibits an extremely strong, identifiable, and narrow molecular rotation absorption feature centered at 557 GHz that will modulate the strength of radar echoes from nearby terrain. The magnitude of beam attenuation depends on the precise frequency of the radar transmission and the water vapor abundance along the radar beam&#x27;s line of sight. By taking ratios of echo powers between different frequencies along the wing of the water absorption line, and between ground targets at different distances, WASSR can obtain, for the first time ever, range-resolved, absolute humidity estimates. Furthermore, WASSR requires no calibration because its ratio measurements are independent of the ground reflectivity, the radar&#x27;s transmit power, and its receiver sensitivity &#x13; all common mode factors that drop out in a frequency- and range-differential measurement. The central measurement objectives of WASSR are to accurately measure local water vapor mixing ratios over diurnal, seasonal, and yearly time scales; to probe the vertical distribution of water vapor up to 2 km in altitude; and to map ground-level humidity with sufficient range resolution to discern differences in atmospheric water vapor exchange with localized geologic features. Mounted on a two-axis gimbal, WASSR will be able to generate maps of local absolute humidity at ground level by scanning its beam over the terrain at low grazing angles. This functionality may reveal localized regions of higher or lower humidity, perhaps arising from different soil composition, evaporation, or even brine flows. Likewise, beam-scanning up the slopes of nearby topography can validate or constrain models about the variation of humidity with altitude. WASSR can also operate with high accuracy at all times of the day or night in any season, overcoming the limitations of the past relative humidity measurements made by the Curiosity rover. WASSR is thus an excellent candidate for future Mars missions that seek to understand the processes by which water travels in the Martian atmosphere, is exchanged with its soil, and affects astrobiological potential. WASSR&#x27;s design will be based on low-power millimeter- and submillimeter-wave radar systems that JPL has built over the last decade, especially a 95 GHz Doppler radar prototype for comet jet observations and a 183 GHz humidity-sounding cloud radar for Earth science applications. Special enabling technologies for WASSR include a low-power W-band synthesizer, efficient Schottky diode frequency-multipliers and mixers, and an FPGA-based digital processor. At the conclusion of this MatISSE-18 effort, WASSR will be near TRL 6 and thus well positioned to compete for selection in prime Mars rover or lander missions as soon as the 2020s. The development of WASSR will also open up a whole new class of compact flight instruments for emerging submillimeter-wave radar applications in space, such as water vapor detection from orbit around Mars or on comets or icy moons, and short-range spacecraft navigation for landing or docking.",

      "description": "We propose to observe Mars globally from orbit in visible and infrared wavelengths to monitor its atmosphere. This effort builds on nearly continuous observations since 1998 by MGS, followed by MRO, of nearly 16 Mars years of meteorological phenomena. Visible imaging provides infor-mation on dust and water ice cloud distribution, and IR imaging provides, through filters, temperatures of the surface and atmospheric dust (at 7.6, 9.1, and 12.1 &#x14; 1.0 &#xbc;m), and at several heights in the atmosphere by &quot;narrow&quot; band imaging within the 15 &#xbc;m atmospheric CO2 band (14.9&#x14;0.67, 15.6&#x14;0.73, and 16.0&#x14;0.77 &#xbc;m). Additionally, the orbiter can act as a surface asset relay, as it carries a microProximity-1 UHF radio. Appropriate Optics focal length and Orbit altitude provide global coverage to at least 100 km above the limb, and good SNR for radio relay functions. This mission consists of seven phases: 1) EM-1 (SLS) launch to C3 = 0 cis-lunar space and a lunar flyby, 2) aphelion raise to 1.94 AU (4910 m/sec delta-V over 97 days), 3) interplanetary coast for 291 days, 4) perihelion raise to 1.54 AU (1300 m/sec delta-V over 92 days), 5) another interplanetary coast of 214 days, 6) transition to the sphere of gravitational influence of Mars (Mars rendezvous ~ 1680 m/sec delta-V over 28 days), 7) spiral down to science orbit (~1670 m/sec delta-V over 34 days) and nominal science operations. The long cruise (760 days) results from the launch delay of the EM-1 mission from 12/15/17 (an optimum time to launch for an ion-propulsion system) to 7/31/18 (a nearly worse case time to launch for any propulsion system, around opposition). Only 1 month of operations can be completed during the Program defined 5-year project limit, but the vehicle will be fully capable of completing a 1 Mars Year mission during a requested Science Enhancement Option through August 2022. The spacecraft, constrained to fit the Cubesat 6U interface, is dominated by a mission-enabling ion thruster and its single propellant volume (an Ion CAT thruster supplied by U. Michigan) that uses a eutectic metal alloy of gallium, indium and tin. Attitude control is provided by a precision miniaturized star tracker (with &lt;1 arc min capability) and three 60 mNms reaction wheels. The single ion thruster is gimbaled to compensate for CG shifts and also to off-load reaction wheels (the third wheel axis is off-loaded by adjusting satellite roll angle and its solar panel). A radiation-tolerant spacecraft processor is used for housekeeping functions, attitude control and for payload interface and data management. The avionics system has robust SEU recovery. Two deployable and steerable 3 segment solar panels (eHawk or similar) can generate ~170 W at 1 AU at the be-ginning of the mission and ~70 W at Mars during science operations. Communication functions are provided by a S-Band receiver (with two body mounted 2&#xc0; sterradian patch antennas facing in opposite directions, with one always facing towards the sun) and Ka-band transmitter (with 2.5 Watt RF output and a body-mounted ~30 dB surface-attached HGA). Science downlink supports a 116 kbps data rate during the primary science phase, which decrements slowly to 7 kbps at the worst-case Earth Mars distance. Deep-space navigation relies on standard DSN differential VLBI (&#x6;-DOR).

      "description": "Life may have appeared on Earth very early on, following the Moon-forming impact, but the conditions leading to the emergence of the first pre-biotic compounds are still under debate. The famous Miller-Urey experiments and many subsequent ones have shown that discharges in reducing gas mixtures, such as various combinations of H2O, H2, N2, NH3, CH4, CO, CO2 and H2S, can lead to pre-biotic molecules. However, theoretical models and known volcanic gas compositions do not favor early Earth atmospheres as reducing as laboratory experiments. In fact, Urey believed that reduced atmospheres would exist only transiently in the intervals between volatile delivery by asteroids or comets and hydrogen escape to space, and not as a stable steady state. This hypothesis has never actually been tested. We propose to theoretically investigate how a transient Miller-Urey atmosphere can emerge on Earth due to large impacts during late accretion. This naturally follows the Moon-forming impact and precedes the emergence of life. A large amount of volatiles is thought to have been brought during late accretion, and big impacts with longer cooling times favor the formation of CH4 and NH3. Moreover, post impact chemistry of chondritic material was found to be rich in H2, CH4 and NH3 (Urey 1951, Schaefer and Fegley 2007, Hashimoto et al. 2007). We will analyze a wide range of impactor material, with compositions specific to chondrites, comets, and differentiated planetesimals. We will link impact-generated thermochemistry, atmospheric photochemistry, and atmospheric radiative transfer to follow the chemical and thermal evolution of atmospheres kick-started by very large impacts. The timescales calculated will be relevant to the formation of aldehydes and HCN (amino acid precursors) in the atmosphere. Our photochemistry model also contains the formation and destruction of organic hazes, while the detailed chemistry may also reveal the presence of some pre-biotic reaction catalysts. Our main focus is the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere prior to the emergence of life, but the generality of our methods also allows us to look at the effects of large impacts on the atmospheres of Mars and Titan. This will provide a more general view on the possible emergence of pre-biotic environments in the Solar System. Our team has an extensive expertise in the chemistry, radiative transfer, and atmospheric kinetic processes relevant to this study. Our recent work has analyzed the emerging atmospheres of terrestrial planets after giant impacts, using a well-established radiative-convective atmospheric structure code, with an extensive opacity database for all relevant molecules, and the chemistry self-consistently calculated for vapor in equilibrium with a magma ocean (Lupu et al. 2014). We have also developed the chemistry code to study the transient impact chemistry and photochemistry, including nearly all the small molecules and free radicals that can be made from H, C, N, O, and S. The development of the atmospheric code and the atmospheric structure calculations will be performed by R. Lupu, S. Vahidinia and M. Marley at NASA Ames, and by T. Robinson at UCSC. S. Vahidinia will also perform calculations related to haze and cloud aggregate opacities. R. Freedman at SETI Institute will advise on molecular opacity updates. The atmospheric chemistry grids will be provided by B. Fegley at Washington University. The photochemistry and impact chemistry calculations will be performed by K. Zahnle at NASA Ames. This proposal is relevant to the &quot;prebiotic evolution&quot; part of Exobiology program by looking at &quot;models of early environments on the Earth in which organic chemical synthesis could occur&quot;. With the applications to Mars and Titan we will also address the &quot;Biosignatures and Life Elsewhere&quot; goal, &quot;relating what is known about the origin of life on Earth to the potential for the origin and establishment of life under conditions prevailing on other planetary bodies&quot;.",

      "description": "Aerocapture is an orbit insertion technique that offers significant reductions in mass and cost for a large number of space missions. Despite its benefits, one of the main reasons that aerocapture has not been used on a flight mission is that it has not yet been flight tested. The research proposed here will address this problem by designing an Earth-based aerocapture flight test utilizing a smallsat. Conceptual design of the flight test will focus on producing a fully-documented mission concept to demonstrate aerocapture. One of the primary conceptual challenges involves developing an aerocapture flight system for use on a smallsat. Techniques such as drag modulation-based energy control will be considered to reduce the system complexity. System selection will be accomplished through means of a comprehensive trade study; focus will be placed on control and thermal requirements, simplicity, and the applicability of the system to other missions. The chosen system will drive other facets of mission design, such as the guidance method utilized by the smallsat and selection of the mission trajectory. The second phase of this research will focus on physically developing and testing the aerocapture system and spacecraft in preparation for the smallsat test flight. A secondary payload mission architecture will be utilized for the flight test to minimize cost. The design process of the spacecraft will offer a number of opportunities for student leadership and multidisciplinary collaboration. A successful demonstration will show that aerocapture can be used as an effective means of orbit insertion at Mars and other atmospheric worlds, with scalable applications to both large and small spacecraft and missions.",

      "description": "The leading option for extracting oxygen from the Mars atmospheric carbon dioxide is to use a solid oxide electrolyzer, which removes one oxygen atom from the CO2 molecule, ionizes it, and pulls it through a solid electrolyte by applying an electrical potential across the cell. An assessment of the state-of-the-art is being performed to examine past and current development efforts in dry CO2 solid oxide electrolysis (SOE), and to identify key enablers and critical technology gaps for achieving the scale-up, stable performance, and long life needed for future human missions to the Mars surface. Differences in fabrication methods, reliability, scalability, thermal cycling, thermal ramp rates, thermal gradients among the ceramic layers, operating pressure, stack sealing, and longevity are also being evaluated. Structural and thermal modeling of a small stack is leading to new designs for the manifolds to increase structural strength and improve gas distribution through the stack. New manifold designs, 3D printed out of zirconia oxide to match the thermal expansion coefficient in the stack, will be tested for fluid and structural performance. In FY19 and FY20, small scale SOE stacks from multiple commercial providers will be procured and independently tested and characterized in NASA facilities. Oxygen production is part of the AES In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) Technology Project which is developing the component, subsystem, and system technology to enable production of mission consumables from regolith and atmospheric resources at a variety of destinations for future human exploration missions. The overall goals of the ISRU Technology project are to achieve system-level TRL 6 to support future flight demonstration missions and provide exploration architecture teams with validated, high-fidelity answers for mass, power, and volume of ISRU systems. The project&#x27;s initial focus is on critical technology gap closure and component development in a relevant environment (TRL 5) for Resource Acquisition (excavation, drilling, atmosphere collection, and preparation/beneficiation before processing) and Resource Processing &amp; Consumable Production (extraction and processing of resources into products with immediate use as propellants, life support gases, fuel cell reactants, and feedstock for construction and manufacturing). The interim project goal is to complete ISRU subsystem tests in a relevant environment to advance the subsystem to TRL 6. The project end goals are to perform end-to-end ISRU system tests in a relevant environment (system TRL 6) and integrated ISRU-exploration elements demonstrations in a relevant environment. ISRU is a disruptive capability that enables more affordable exploration than today&#x19;s paradigm where all supplies are brought from Earth, and allows more sustainable architectures to be developed. The availability of ISRU technologies can radically change the mission architecture and be the sizing design driver for other complex systems already in development. For example, the current Mars architecture assumes ISRU production of up to 30 metric tons of propellant on the Mars surface in order to reduce the ascent vehicle landed mass by 75 percent and reduce Earth launch needs by at least 300 metric tons. If a decision was made to use storable propellants for the Mars ascent vehicle instead of ISRU-producible oxygen and methane, many other drastic changes to the architecture could be required, such as lander and ascent vehicle size, number of landers needed, surface operations for ascent vehicle fueling, and Mars rendezvous orbit. Other surface systems might become more complex or heavier if they are not designed to take full advantage of ISRU technologies. Examples include a more complex closed-loop life support system if resupply with ISRU water cannot be assumed, or a heavy, built-in habitat radiation shield if a water- or regolith-based shield cannot be added after habitat delivery to the surface. Other system designers may also make decisions that reduce the benefit of incorporating ISRU into the mission, resulting in a larger or more inefficient ISRU system. For example, a non-continuous power source such as solar power would increase the required production rate and peak power of an ISRU plant, thus increasing its size and complexity due to hundreds of start-stop cycles. However, a continuous power source, such as nuclear or solar power with storage, would allow an ISRU plant to operate continuously, thus minimizing its size, complexity, and power draw. These are only a few examples of how the inclusion of ISRU has ripple effects across many other exploration elements. ISRU is also a new capability that has never before been demonstrated in space or on another extraterrestrial body. Every other exploration system or element, such as power, propulsion, habitats, landers, life support, rovers, etc., have some form of flight heritage, although almost all still need technology development to achieve the objectives of future missions. This is another critical reason why ISRU technology development, leading to a flight demonstration mission, needs to be started now, so that flight demonstration results can be obtained early enough to ensure that lessons learned can be incorporated into the final design.",

      "description": "Whether a young Mars harbored microbial life remains unknown. The answer to this question would have ramifications for our understanding of the development of life on both Earth and elsewhere. Searching for life on Mars has been hindered by the difficulty of finding pristine samples that could contain organic compounds. The absence of a substantial atmosphere and global magnetic field has left the top 1-2 m of the planet&#x27;s surface thoroughly irradiated, necessitating the capture of deeper samples for astrobiological research. Martian lava tube caves present an opportunity to access protected underground samples without the need for heavy and complex drilling equipment. Robust robots capable of traversing lava tube terrain could travel from tube entrances (skylights) and obtain protected samples deeper within the tubes. Technology capable of exploring Martian lava tubes could also be used to map them, as lava tubes are considered to be a possible location for human settlement on Mars. I propose to develop a novel robot design capable of exploring Martian lava tubes. While robots that may be able to navigate this environment exist, none are both small enough that multiple can be sent, but capable of complex maneuvers to traverse obstacles. I propose to design and prototype a 1-2 kg robot to meet these constraints. The starting point will be my research with the Stockton Group at Georgia Tech, during which I have designed a robot that implements positionable arms that pull and climb with continuous tracks. While this design will likely evolve with time, the end result will be capable of reaching pristine samples to perform in-situ analysis within lava tubes. The NSTRF fellowship would allow me to develop this early research into a robust and tested robot design.",

      "description": "Several technologies are being evaluated to extract water from a variety of water-bearing extraterrestrial soils, including near-surface granular and hard hydrated soils, and subsurface ice at Mars, as well as frozen icy soils in the near permanently shadowed regions at the lunar poles. The water can be extracted from the raw resources either by transferring the raw resource into a processor, or by processing the raw resources in situ (where they are found). One technical approach under investigation is to transfer water-containing soil to a closed processor in either a batch mode or semi-continuously, then apply energy to liberate the water. Currently, terrestrial screw conveyor soil dryers are being investigated at Johnson Space Center (JSC) for their adaptability to use in lunar or Mars conditions. At the same time, NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) is investigating the use of microwave energy to liberate water from soil as it flows through a processor. A second technical approach under investigation is to deposit water-containing soil onto a heated surface and use the Mars atmosphere as a sweep gas to collect any water vapor released in an &#x18;open-air&#x19; continuous process. NASA Glenn Research Center (GRC) is investigating this approach to continually harvest water as the rover/excavator roams the surface. While this process may lose some of the evolved water, it eliminates the need for reusable, high-temperature, dusty seals, and provides heat at the granular level to reduce long heating times. A third technical approach under investigation is to extract the water directly from the raw resource without any excavation of the soil. NASA Johnson Space Center (JSC) is evaluating the terrestrial Rodriguez Well approach used in Antarctica for potential use on Mars to access nearly-pure ice deposits at some depth below the surface. This approach first requires a hole to be drilled through any overburden and into the ice sheet. Heat is then applied directly to the ice sheet to melt the ice into a liquid which could then be pumped out when needed. An evaluation is underway as to the viability of the approach at Mars environmental conditions.

      "description": "When spacecraft enter an atmosphere, they require the use of a thermal protection system (TPS) to mitigate the harsh aerothermal environment. NASA relies heavily on computational modeling to design and size TPS for planetary missions. However, post-flight analysis of NASA missions often reveals discrepancies between predicted and actual behavior, and highlights the need for improved first-principles modeling. High-fidelity modeling of ablation poses significant challenges due to the multi-physics and multi-scale nature of the phenomena, and the difficulty in conducting experiments representative of atmospheric entry conditions. One area of potential improvement is in better understanding the micro-scale behavior and decomposition of heat shield materials, and upscaling the micro-scale behavior to macro-scale modeling. In this proposed work, a multi-physics computational framework will be developed to study the micro-scale decomposition behavior of ablative thermal protection systems. The proposed research will include modeling high-temperature flow though porous media using Direct Simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) methods, given the non-continuum conditions that exist during an atmospheric entry. Within the DSMC framework, oxidation at the fiber scale, including pitting dynamics (the non-uniform way in which carbon fibers oxidize), as well as solid and radiative heat transfer, will be simulated. Oxidation modeling will be coupled with mechanical failure modeling of the carbon fibers, including thermal stresses and fluid-structure interactions. The computational framework will be used to model the thermochemical and mechanical erosion that occurs when a spacecraft enters an atmosphere, including those with atmospheric dust, such as Mars. The proposed work aims to improve NASA&#x19;s understanding of micro-scale material response of TPS, and use that understanding to improve macro-scale modeling and help NASA prepare for the entry systems challenges of future missions. In particular, this work hopes address fundamental questions in the mechanical erosion of heat shield materials, a critical source of uncertainty in atmospheric modeling.",

Showcase a continuous and semiautonomous biomanufacturing of fuel, materials, pharmaceuticals, and food in Mars-like conditions. NASA&#x19;s 2015 Journey to Mars document describes the next pioneering steps in space exploration through three tiers of missions: Earth Reliant, Proving Ground, and Earth Independent. CUBES will be strategically aligned with all three tiers. A CUBES demonstration biosystem will baseline future Earth Reliant testing in 3D-printing, in situ resource utilization, and food and pharmaceutical production. CUBES research could help minimize resupply needs on a Proving Ground mission. Finally, use of the CUBES-produced biosystem to harvest Martian resources for fuel, water, oxygen, and building materials will satisfy requirements for Earth Independence. CUBES will be organized into four divisions to achieve this planned showcase. The requisite systems design and engineering efforts to optimally allocate and utilize Mars resources, tightly integrate and automate internal processes, and satisfactorily achieve biological and mechanical performance according to mission specifications will be the domain of the Systems Design and Integration Division (SDID). Activities to harness in situ resources, decontaminate and enrich regolith, and transform human and mission wastes to media and feedstocks for utilization by downstream processes will be the responsibility of the Microbial Media and Feedstocks Division (MMFD). The manufacture of propellants, biopolymers and useful chemicals from MMFD media and feedstocks along with the recycling of manufactured products at the end of their serviceable life will be tasked to the Biofuel and Biomaterial Manufacturing Division (BBMD). A key component of the BBMD-SDID interface will be the use of generated biopolymers in additive manufacturing (3D-printing). Plant and microbial engineering to realize food and pharmaceuticals for astronauts along with the recycling of plant wastes will be the focus of the Food and Pharmaceutical Synthesis Division (FPSD). The primary CUBES research objectives are: 1. In situ microbial media production, which harnesses Mars atmospheric and regolith resources for downstream biological use; 2. In situ manufacture of mission products, which creates outputs like propellants and building materials that are fundamental enablers of any long-duration space mission; 3. In situ food and pharmaceutical synthesis, which allows these long-duration space missions to be manned, and uses plants and microbes that provide food, nutrients and medicine; and 4. Space and complex systems engineering, which analyzes, guides, tests, improves, and integrates the internal processes of objectives 1-3 above. The CUBES goal of efficiently using in situ resources and effectively recycling them to drive the manufacture of useful products will meet a long-standing need for space missions, which is to substantially reduce manufacturing-infrastructure mass and related costs in harsh conditions. The planned CUBES output of a semi-closed loop that integrates resource-recovery in a resource-poor environment with waste streams to biologically drive the manufacture of fuel, materials, pharmaceuticals, and food will establish the capacity to biologically support manned space exploration on par with abiotic techniques. CUBES benefits will include: 1. Engineered microbes to convert limited or marginally accessible Martian feedstocks, such as atmospheric gases at low partial pressure and nutrients from contaminated/toxic land, into valuable commodities. 2. Novel biologically-coupled nanotechnologies to fix available carbon and nitrogen and to transfer energy into biosynthetic processes; 3.

Namely the understanding of the physical processes and ability to protect the space vehicle from the harsh conditions encountered in hypersonic atmosphere entries must be expanded upon. Researchers depend on computational models and ground facility scale tests to study the performance of thermal protection systems [TPS] that protect space vehicles from the high temperature gases involved. However, the conditions reproduced at current complexes such as plasma flow wind tunnels cannot match simultaneously all of the actual flight conditions. More importantly, the aerothermal environment on the entire vehicle cannot be reproduced. It can only be approximated at few points such as the stagnation line. The need for proper uncertainty quantification and propagation of, including but not limited to, epistemic uncertainty of systems is outlined in section 11.3.6 of TA-11 as well as validation of modeling tools in section 11.3.8.1 of TA-11. The proposed work focuses on the development of a stochastic model for enhancing the ability to extrapolate arc-jet facility TPS data to flight conditions as well as validation and uncertainty quantification through Bayesian methods. It has been shown that even for small probes, radiative heating constitutes 10% of the total heat flux [Chazot]. However, current plasma flow wind tunnel methodologies are unable to reproduce the effects of the radiative processes or the Mach number of the flow experienced in hypersonic Mars return atmosphere entries. By applying a stochastic model to arc-jet facility data that accounts for the inability to recreate all flight conditions at the stagnation point, and propagation and quantification of uncertainty of the system, the confidence with which the results can be extrapolated will be increased and limitations made known. The statistical approach to model validation will be tested using EFT1 flight data. The construction of the stochastic model and planned uncertainty quantification and validation treatments will help increase the compatibility of ground facility results with flight conditions.",

      "description": "Aerocapture is an orbit insertion maneuver that uses drag of a planetary atmosphere on a spacecraft to transfer it from a hyperbolic trajectory to a closed elliptic orbit. This technique can greatly reduce cost or increase delivered payload mass and it is an enabling technology for otherwise infeasible missions to Jupiter, Saturn, and Neptune (Hall et al, 2005). Although several relatively mature aerocapture technologies are under development, the associated risks of performing this maneuver have prevented them from ever being used on a mission. Current aerocapture devices rely on aeroshells, solid structures that deflect atmospheric flow, and are therefore susceptible to the high heat and dynamic pressure inherent to hypersonic reentry. Aeroshells are limited in size due to launch vehicle constraints and must fly deep in the atmosphere to achieve the necessary drag for orbit insertion. Such trajectories are highly sensitive to perturbations and uncertainties in the local environment, which can be significant in the poorly understood atmospheres beyond Mars. Plasma aerocapture leverages an entry technology called a magnetoshell to achieve orbit with lower heating and dynamic pressures than standard aerocapture systems. A magnetoshell consists of a plasma confined by an applied magnetic field which is fixed to the spacecraft. Some plasma is seeded into the field from onboard fuel storage to initially generate the magnetoshell. Rather than deflect the atmospheric flow as an aeroshell does, the plasma absorbs and utilizes the neutral atmosphere during the maneuver. Thus, the magnetoshell requires little thermal protection since the flow energy is deposited in the plasma and not the spacecraft structure. The plasma is sustained entirely from the mass and energy captured from the atmosphere rather than any onboard fuel and power; only power to the magnet is required to keep the magnetoshell operational. Additionally, the area over which flow interacts with the plasma is defined by the strength of the magnetic field, so the area can be made larger than that of a mechanically deployed decelerator. This means aerocapture is achieved at higher altitudes where dynamic pressure and sensitivity to atmospheric perturbations are lower. By controlling the magnetic field strength, the drag can be modulated continuously, enabling robust control over the flight trajectory. This research aims to determine whether plasma aerocapture is a feasible solution for delivering spacecraft to targets with atmospheres. Because of the novel physics of the magnetoshell, feasibility hinges on multiple questions. First, I will develop an analytic model of the plasma interaction with an atmospheric flow representative of the aerocapture environment. This model will reveal the fundamental physics governing the plasma and the scaling of drag with input parameters such as magnetoshell design and atmospheric conditions. Second, I will develop an experiment to validate the physics observed in the analytic model. This experiment will consist of a subscale magnetoshell impacted by a low-energy neutral beam in a novel &#x1c;wind tunnel&#x1d; approach simulating aerocapture conditions. The magnetoshell drag will be measured using a thrust stand and plasma diagnostics will analyze crucial parameters governing performance. Finally, with a solid understanding of these physics, I will develop a tool for simulating trajectories of plasma aerocapture in NASA&#x19;s Program to Optimize Simulated Trajectories II (POST2). This module will combine the performance scaling found by the analytic model and experiment with spacecraft configuration parameters so that mission designers can develop plasma aerocapture mission architectures. Addressing these three research areas will ultimately determine whether plasma aerocapture can be reasonably implemented aboard a spacecraft, opening the door to future mission development and solar system exploration.",

      "description": "Landers and rovers have been critical for the exploration of Mars. While past missions have been successful, we are reaching the extent of what we can land on Mars using incremental advances of Viking-technology, placing limitations on the mass, landing location and accuracy of the entry vehicle. In order to send more massive rovers to Mars it is necessary that we develop new technologies to increase our atmospheric entry and landing capabilities. This is needed in order to enable future human-precursor and human-scale missions to Mars. One possible technology to enable future high mass missions to Mars is the use of Supersonic Retropropulsion (SRP). SRP involves using thrusters directed in opposition to the oncoming airflow to decelerate the entry vehicle while it is traveling at supersonic speeds. Because of the propellant and oxidizer mass required for the additional thrusters, currently proposed SRP configurations require a significant increase in performance and efficiency before they can be considered an effective solution for Mars missions. A possible means to improve SRP performance and mass-efficiency is the use of an atmospheric-breathing propulsion system for the SRP thrusters. An atmospheric-breathing propulsion system, unlike a conventional rocket propulsion system, does not carry the oxidizer within the craft itself. It instead ingests the oxidizer from the surrounding atmosphere and combines it with the fuel carried onboard to create thrust. Because the oxidizer is not carried within the vehicle this significantly reduces the mass and volume requirements of the entry system. In the case of a Mars lander, this oxidizer would have to be carried throughout the entirety of the mission (from Earth departure until Mars descent); as such, its elimination from the vehicle may result in a significant performance advantage. A significant challenge with using an atmospheric-breathing propulsion system on Mars is that the Mars atmosphere consists largely of CO2, not air. Thus, traditional oxygen combustion is not possible. Instead, innovative combustion techniques need to be developed that allow for combustion using CO2 as an oxidizer. The initial feasibility of such systems has been demonstrated such as the production of thrust from the combustion of Magnesium powder and other fuels with CO2. These initial efforts demonstrate that an atmospheric-breathing SRP system on an Entry, Descent and Landing (EDL) vehicle may be possible. The objective of this project is to design and demonstrate the feasibility of an atmospheric-breathing supersonic retropropulsion descent system for use on a Mars entry vehicle. The resulting descent system would effectively integrate three technological developments: supersonic retropropulsion, atmospheric-breathing propulsion and CO2 based combustion in an integrated vehicle design process. Development of the integrated system will involve propulsion and vehicle design to first develop a feasible atmospheric-breathing propulsion system utilizing the Mars atmosphere and second, integrate that system within an entry vehicle as a cohesive and robust EDL system.

Supporting the system design will be computational analysis in addition to small-scale experimental work. The advantage of this integrated EDL solution is to increase the current capabilities of Mars landers so that they can achieve a wider range of landing sites, land with greater precision and land higher mass payloads The descent system will be designed to support high mass payloads and enable future human-scale missions to Mars.",

      "description": "Introduction: The zone of interaction between water or ice and lava has been proposed as a potential habitat for microbes on Mars, therefore the ability to detect regions of past water or ice-lava interaction on Mars will help future missions target specific areas where signs of life may be found. These interactions are preserved in the rock record because lava that interacts with water or ice, even briefly, will quench or freeze rapidly preventing further crystallization from occurring at that margin. As rocks become progressively less glassy and more crystal-rich, they emit higher levels of reflected light, meaning the crystal content can be detected with VNIR and FTIR spectroscopy. However, as there are several factors that influence overall reflectance, including whole-rock chemistry, the number of phenocrysts originating in the magma chamber, and the influence of alteration minerals which may have formed from more modern atmospheric processes. Therefore, a robust method to identify regions of water/ice-lava interactions on Earth and Mars requires analyses of bulk chemistry, phenocryst count, and degree of alteration in places which erupted lava into ice, water, and in dry conditions. To recommend how to locate these areas on Mars we will first characterize the whole-rock chemistry, the degree of alteration, mineralogy, and the crystal texture of three terrestrial analog sites with different hydrologic environments and second determine the fastest instrument protocol for the detection of rapidly quenched lava margins (Fig. 1). Locations include the Lost Jim flow in Alaska, the Holuhruan flow in Iceland, and the Blue Dragon flow at the Craters of the Moon in Idaho, where lava interacted with ice, water, and at dry conditions, respectively. All three sites exhibit surface features (e.g., rootless cones) similar to those described at Cerberus Palus and Martes Valles on Mars commonly cited as evidence for lava-water interaction, have similar bulk chemistry, suffered little physical and chemical weathering, and erupted in similar geologic settings, allowing us to pinpoint the effect of environmental conditions (presence of water) on lava morphology/crystallinity and allow us to make recommendations for identifying past water-rich environments on Mars. Goals and objectives: (1) Science: Characterize the spectral signature of mafic lava margins quenched in hydrous and icy environments (PI Rader, 2 graduate students, Co-I Bishop and undergraduate student). (2) Science Operations: Develop a protocol for sample prioritization to focus on finding ancient microbial habitat during Mars exploration (Co-I Sehlke, PI Rader). (3) Technology: Produce recommendations for the use of portable instruments to enable rapid and detailed geologic mapping using the bulk chemistry of volcanic rocks on Mars&#x27; surface by humans and/or rovers (Co-I Sehlke). Methodology: Protocols for the usage of spectrometers for the detection of water/ice-lava interactions in the absence of alteration do not yet exist, although similar science instruments are currently in use or are planned to be deployed during future rover mission on Mars (Table 1). We propose to use spectrometers for in-situ measurements, including a handheld visible near-infrared (VNIR), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and a laser induced breakdown spectrometer (LIBS) to build a protocol by finding cutoff values which correspond to different environmental conditions of lava flow emplacement. Our resulting operational protocols will leverage the capabilities of all four portable instruments and sampling requirements to identify regions where lava interacted with water or ice, which will help streamline the search for ancient life on Mars, inform us about cooling rates in lava flows within hydrologic environments on Earth, and provide a simple decision tree to characterize geochemistry to understand Mars petrogenesis.",

      "description": "On any planet with an atmosphere and granular material on the surface, wind-driven grain movement is a fundamental process of sediment transport and deposition, and landscape transformation. Wind moves the finest particles (&quot;dust&quot;) in suspension, resulting in dust devils and dust storms observed on Earth and Mars. Somewhat coarser grains (&quot;sand&quot;) cannot become suspended and instead are driven downwind in a series of hops across the surface called &quot;saltation.&quot; Saltating sand accumulates into drifts, ripples, and the dunes seen on Earth, Mars and Titan. These saltating sand grains, because of their coarseness and the speed with which they are driven across the surface, have significant potential to abrade materials they impact against. This can have effects not only on geomorphology, but is also a serious engineering hazard for both manned and robotic planetary explorers. Saltation has proven to be a difficult process to study and understand, partly because of its dynamic character. The first fundamental question about saltation involves determining the minimum wind strength required to mobilize sand, under the various conditions on Earth, Mars or Titan. A second fundamental question involves the actual flux of saltating grains (their speed and number density), and how this depends on the grain and atmosphere characteristics, gravity, wind speed, and height above the ground. Most state-of-the-art sensors for measuring saltating grain movements are unsuitable for robotic missions, requiring complex servicing to extract measurements. The most viable candidate for remote application, the &quot;Sensit&quot; instrument (commonly used in terrestrial field studies), only yields the grain impact rate and an estimate of the typical energy impacting the sensor over an interval at its single sensing height (i.e., with no vertical resolution on the flux). Impacts from small, high-speed grains cannot be distinguished from lower-speed impacts of larger grains. We have developed a science traceability matrix establishing what is required to advance our general understanding of saltation in planetary environments. None of the existing instrumentation can fulfill these measurement requirements, especially considering the accommodation requirements for planetary instrumentation. We propose a technical approach to an instrument that would meet these measurement requirements and be well-suited to accommodation on a wide variety of planetary landers, rovers or aircraft. We propose to adapt capacitive ultrasonic transducers (as used in our Martian Sonic Anemometer) to instead passively detect grain impacts. We have completed a preliminary proof-of-concept showing that we can extract information separately about impact energy and impact momentum from the signal generated during each impact. We have also demonstrated a conceptual approach to add position sensing to such a grain impact transducer to yield also each impact location. We propose to mature these transducer designs to optimize their ability to determine separately impact energy, momentum and position and to ensure durability of the sensors in the erosive saltating sand flux. We also propose developing the signal processing instrument back-end to handle the data stream from an array of such impact sensing transducers, and digest it to efficient and economically-sized information in light of limited spacecraft downlink availability. We anticipate no planetary protection hurdles for this heat- and disinfectant-tolerant instrument. The saltation sensor is currently at TRL ~2, but we expect to mature it up to TRL ~5 by the end of this work, poising it well to be proposed to space flight opportunities.",

      "description": "We propose to design and demonstrate the key capabilities of a multifunctional atmospheric lidar for Mars orbit. This lidar will simultaneously measure CO2 column density, wind profiles, and atmospheric backscatter and depolarization profiles ideally from polar orbit. These measurements address high priority needs for Mars as summarized in the 2011 Planetary Decadal Survey. Although considerable progress has been made, knowledge of the present Mars atmosphere is limited by a lack of observations in several key areas including diurnal variations of aerosols, water vapor and direct measurements of wind velocity. For example, both MGS and MRO observed only afternoon and early morning local time. Both dust and water ice aerosols are pervasive in the Mars atmosphere. Dust interacts strongly with IR radiation causing large changes in the thermal structure and acting as a driver of atmospheric motions at all spatial scales. Water ice clouds play an important role in the water cycle altering the global transport of water vapor. The limited local time coverage of observations to date has shown large changes in the amount and vertical distribution of dust and ice aerosols and water vapor. However, existing observations do not allow the full diurnal cycle of water vapor, dust and ice aerosols to be characterized. Winds on Mars also play a fundamental role, yet basic questions still remain about the 3-D wind structure and how it changes with local time, location, and season. Despite low atmospheric density, the winds are often strong enough to raise large amounts of dust from the surface, and at times the planet can become almost completely enshrouded. The winds transport water vapor, dust and ice aerosols, and mix all atmospheric gaseous constituents. Winds regulate the transfer of water vapor and heat throughout the atmosphere and are a primary player in all surface-atmosphere interactions. Wind velocities provide sensitive input and validation for Global Circulation Models (GCMs), and knowledge of winds is critical for the safety and precision of spacecraft entry, descent and landing (EDL). Despite the importance of winds on Mars, presently there are only a few direct observations of them, and indirect inferences are often imprecise and contain many assumptions. Because the Mars atmospheric dust cycles and CO2 cycles are coupled, and because they both partially drive the wind fields, it is important to measure the dust, wind and CO2 quantities simultaneously. It would be ideal to measure them with the same instrument operating continuously, day and night, from a polar orbit, and this proposed lidar approach is uniquely capable of meeting this need. The targeted lidar is MOLA instrument-sized (a ~80 cm cube) that uses pulsed lasers and the direct detection technique. The transmitter uses small, efficient wavelength tunable lasers that operate on and near a single CO2 line in the 1533 nm CO2 band. The receiver uses a 70 cm diameter receiver telescope and new highly sensitive detectors. This approach allows us to leverage in considerable technology from our ongoing work measuring CO2 in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere as supported by the ASCENDS definition and the ESTO IIP and ACT programs. This technology leverage greatly reduces risk, development time and cost. Our goal is developing a strong science investigation and instrument for several Mars opportunities. The highest priority is to prepare for a strong science and instrument proposal for the 2020 Mars launch opportunities. Alternatively this instrument and an optical spectrometer optimized for atmospheric measurements are complementary and are ideally suited as a science payload for a Mars-orbiter based Discovery Mission.",

This Mars Air Battery (MAB) concept is a Li-CO2 battery that reacts atmospheric CO2 with lithium metal to produce electric power. This enables dramatically high specific energies because the CO2 reactant is not included in the upmass of the battery system. Significantly, the MABs electrodes may also function effectively in an oxygen-rich environment (habitats, spacesuits, etc.) with no loss in battery performance.

      "description": "The multi-NASA center Mars Atmosphere and Regolith COllector/PrOcessor for Lander Operations (MARCO POLO) project was established to build and demonstrate a methane/oxygen propellant production system in a Mars analog environment. The MARCO POLO project will provide a demonstration platform for all aspects of Martian soil and atmospheric processing, beginning with the extraction of water from Martian soil, which would then be electrolyzed into hydrogen (H2) and oxygen (O2), and the capture of carbon dioxide (CO2) from the Martian atmosphere to produce methane (CH4) using H2 from the water. The lander is designed in a modular fashion with an Atmospheric Processing Module (APM), Soil Processing Module, Water Cleanup Module, Water Processing Module, and Power Production Module. Work at the Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has focused on the Atmospheric Processing Module (APM). The purpose of the APM is to freeze CO2 from a simulated Martian atmosphere at Martian pressures (~7 mbar) by using dual cryocoolers. The resulting pressurized CO2 and H2 are fed to a Sabatier reactor to make CH4 and water vapor. The CO2 freezer subsystem has a collection/supply design requirement of 88 g CO2/hr., and the Sabatier subsystem has a design requirement to produce 31.7 g/hr. CH4 fuel and 71.3 g/hr. H2O, which would also be electrolyzed to H2 and O2. The atmosphere of Mars consists of 95.32% CO2, 2.7% nitrogen, 1.6% argon, and trace amounts of water, carbon monoxide, and several other gases. At 7 mbar, the average pressure on the Martian surface, the freezing point of CO2 is 150 K (&#x13;123oC), which makes it necessary to use a cryocooler as the condensation method. Dual cryocoolers are needed to operate in tandem (one collecting CO2 while the other is supplying the Sabatier reactor). The Sunpower Cryotel Model GT Stirling cycle cryocooler has the proper cooling capacity, low mass and power, and space flight heritage. Lab testing of three copper cryocooler cold head designs to collect the CO2 show that only the &#x1c;Ferris Wheel&#x1d; design met the APM requirements. The full APM was designed and constructed during a series of projects at KSC. The current APM CO2 Freezer consists of two cryocoolers and freezing chambers, a chiller to remove heat from the cryocoolers, a vacuum pump to produce Mars pressures in the chambers, two CO2.storage tanks, a mass flow controller for simulated Mars atmosphere, and various valves to control gas flow and cooling water flow. Multiple optimization tests at varying flow rates showed that the CO2 Freezer subsystem captures an average of 99 g CO2/hr. in 1.4 hr. at a feed rate of 1.2 SLPM of Mars gas simulant, well above the required rate of 88 g/hr. The CO2 capture fraction averaged 79% while the CO2 sublimation rate averaged 95 g/hr. As the CO2 sublimes, it is pumped into the storage tanks at the top of Figure 3. To improve the CO2 conversion efficiency of the Sabatier subsystem and to recover unreacted H2, a recycling process was added. After the water product is condensed a membrane module separates the CH4 product from residual CO2 and H2, then a compressor recycles the CO2 and H2 back through the Sabatier reactor. Testing of the new Sabatier reactor without recycling has been promising, with 97% conversion of the CO2 without the overheating experienced with a reactor supplied by JSC. Testing of the recycling system is currently underway with the membrane module producing pure CH4, but without recycling the CO2 and H2 yet. Integration and testing of the Sabatier subsystem and the CO2 Freezer is planned in the near future.",

The following objectives and methods will be undertaken to advance the technology for future crewed missions to Mars. Objective 1 will identify candidate TSILs and electrodes for the cathode compartment of the electrochemical cell. To achieve this, a literature review of potential ionic liquids and cathode materials will be performed in order to identify those suitable for this technology. The next step will be to experimentally verify that they possess desirable characteristics and address knowledge gaps from the literature review. Objective 2 will then evaluate TSILs and electrodes from Objective 1 by characterizing their reaction kinetics, adsorbed species, and intermediates. Rotating disk and rotating ring-disk electrode experiments will be used to study the reduction process of carbon dioxide to methane. The results of these tests will be collectively analyzed to identify and select cathodes and TSILs most conducive to methane production. Objective 3 will focus on designing and fabricating a benchtop-scale electrochemical cell in order to enable the evaluation of selected cathodes and TSILs in a laboratory environment. Objective 4 will characterize the performance of the electrochemical cell with each TSIL and electrode over a range of operating conditions. Candidate components selected at the conclusion of Objective 2 will be integrated into the test article from Objective 3 to parametrically assess the technology on a bench-top scale. The goal is to prove that methane can be selectively produced in relevant operational environments. Objective 5 will assess integrated system-level parameters. The specifications of promising test units, including methane and oxygen production rates, mass, volume and power, will be extrapolated to relevant scales for human spaceflight to enable comparison to functionally similar systems. This research effort is aimed at advancing the technology readiness level of co-electrolysis with TSILs from 2 to 4 by proving the concept of the technology and validating a low-fidelity cell. This will position the technology for further refinement and integration into In-Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) systems. If an ionic liquid can be identified and implemented in a properly designed electrochemical cell, co-electrolysis should reduce the cost, complexity and risk of crewed Mars missions by simplifying oxygen and methane production to a single chemical step. In fact, an ISRU architecture with this technology would require fewer major processes and components, approximately 50% less mass, and 25% less power than the conventional Sabatier/water electrolysis paradigm for propellant and oxygen production. Acknowledging these advantages and the potential for the technology, NASA calls for the development of co-electrolysis with TSILs in its roadmap for Human Exploration Destination Systems.",

These new detectors can detect single photon event and are about 100 times more sensitive than the silicon APDs and photomultiplier tubes used in current laser altimeters in space. The higher sensitivity and pixelated detectors will enable us to increase the number of beams by a factor of 10 compared to the current multi-beam laser altimeter, such as the Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) without increasing the laser power. The spectral response of these new detectors spans from 0.4 to 4.3 micrometers, which broaden the choice of laser wavelengths to enable penetrating atmosphere at one of the spectral transmission windows of certain planetary bodies, such as Titan. The new detectors can also be used in atmosphere backscattering lidars and laser absorption spectrometers with near quantum limited performance. These detectors are based on the recent HgCdTe APD technology developed by DRS Technologies supported by the NASA Earth Science Technology Office (ESTO). We have already developed a prototype device with 2x8 pixel in a micro cryo-cooler. Here we proposed to develop a mid-sized LMPC HgCdTe APD array for multi-beam laser altimeters with at least 10 times more beams than the current technology and pave the way for even larger pixel arrays for future 3-D imaging lidar. Laser altimeters, or lidar, have been used in numerous space missions to measure surface topography, global shape, orbit, and surface reflectance at the laser wavelength. Early planetary laser altimeters, such as the Mars Orbiter Laser Altimeter (MOLA), used a single laser beam to measure the surface elevation profile one per orbit. LOLA is the first multi-beam laser altimeters and shows the great benefit and potential of multi-beam measurements. Besides a much finer and denser ground coverage, it measures the surface slope and roughness from a single laser pulse. It also gives orders of magnitude more cross-over points for orbit and laser beam pointing determination. However the number of laser beams are now limited by the detector sensitivity, size, and the available laser power. The LMPC HgCdTe APD arrays which we propose to develop will have single photon sensitivity and combine individual detector packages into a focal plane array (FPA) to enable a LOLA sized instrument to have 10 times more beams. The United States Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) has already funded DRS after NASA ESTO to produce a large size focal plane array (FPA) but with a simplified read-out integrated circuit (ROIC) for ground-based flash lidar demonstration. We will leverage these investments to develop and demonstrate a 2x30 and a 7x8 pixel array detector (60 and 56 pixels) with full pulse waveform outputs. We will also study the use a single laser with microlens array to illuminate ground surface in a pattern that matches the detector pixel format. Our work plan is to (a) develop a 2x30 and a 7x8 pixel LMPC HgCdTe APD FPA with ROIC for single photon sensitivity linear outputs; (b) integrate the FPA in a low-cost liquid nitrogen Dewar system and characterize the detector performance; (c) investigate the signal waveform processing techniques that are efficient and can later be integrated in the ROIC, and (d) develop a laser transmitter beam formation technique to match the detector pixel patterns. The entry TRLfor the detector and the laser transmitter are TRL-2. We propose a 3-year research and development program to bring them to TRL-4. The target applications are multi-beam laser altimeters and atmosphere backscattering lidar for Mars and other planetary bodies, mid-wave infrared laser spectral absorption lidar for the Moon and asteroids, and proximity operation lidar for asteroid mapping and sample returns.",

Lab studies that link physical properties to their thermal behavior are often hindered by sample size, the diversity of environments and most importantly, the complexity of natural landscapes. Recurring Slope Lineae (RSL) may represent the expression of present-day liquid water and are compelling in that they have driven a significant re-evaluation of how liquid water and habitability on present-day Mars. Pore-filling fluids significantly increase the thermal conductivity of the bulk material and this property has been used to constrain the water content of RSL using Thermal Emission Imaging System (THEMIS) data, though the lower bounds were unable to be constrained with existing data. We propose to make measurements that represent data currently available and likely to be available on future missions simulated by our field team and an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV), with the ultimate goals of: 1) characterizing the variability in thermophysical properties of analog RSL-like terrains, and 2) assessing the measurements necessary (e.g., time of day, pixel scale, topography quality, albedo, etc.) to constrain soil moisture content based on remotely sensed thermophysical data. Methodology: Three specific tasks meet science objectives and produce data useful for current and future Mars missions. Task 1. Acquire a &#x27;full suite&#x27; of observations over a uniform field site and relate this to a thermal model. Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) topography, structure from motion imagery, hyperspectral visible-near infrared (0.4-1.5&#xbc;m), and thermal infrared data of an aeolian sand dune will be acquired over multiple diurnal cycles. These data, when paired with solar and atmospheric flux measurements. will be used with our COMSOL-based thermal model to baseline our modeling approach. In situ measurements of the dune will be made with a commercial thermal effusivity measurement instrument, simulating a non-invasive rover-based approach. We will characterize the geologic context and collect samples for grain size analysis to compare to other measurements. Task 2. Acquire a &#x27;limited suite&#x27; over multiple field sites. A reduced dataset (similar to what would be available form orbit) will be acquired (visible-near infrared imagery, thermal infrared data) over multiple diurnal cycles and input into our model. Field sites to be visited include alluvial fans, lacustrine sedimentary deposits, and playas with varying soil moisture contents in addition to the sand dune site in Task 1 for cross comparison. Each field site will be characterized to assess geologic context and soil moisture with samples collected for grain size analysis. Task 3. Synthesis. We will degrade our data to assess the ability of remote sensing infrared data to discriminate between different terrain. This work place constraints on capabilities of current instruments and guide future instruments on upcoming missions.

      "description": "We propose to design, build a brassboard, and demonstrate the key capabilities of a multifunctional atmospheric lidar (MARLI) for Mars orbit. This lidar will simultaneously measure atmospheric backscatter and depolarization profiles, wind profiles, and range from a near-polar circular orbit. These measurements address very high priority needs for Mars as summarized in the 2011 Planetary Decadal Survey. Knowledge of the present Mars atmosphere is severely limited by a lack of observations in several key areas including diurnal variations of aerosols and direct measurements of wind velocity. Both dust and water ice aerosols are pervasive in the Mars atmosphere. Dust interacts strongly with IR radiation causing large changes in the thermal structure and is a driver of atmospheric motions. Water ice clouds play an important role in the water cycle altering the global transport of water vapor. The limited local time coverage of observations to date has shown large changes in the amount and vertical distribution of dust and ice aerosols. However, existing observations do not allow the vertical distribution of the dust aerosols and ice to be characterized over the full diurnal cycle. Winds on Mars play a fundamental role, yet basic questions still remain about the 3-D wind structure and how it changes with local time, location, and season. Wind velocities provide sensitive input and validation for Global Circulation Models (GCMs), and knowledge of winds is important for the safety and precision of spacecraft entry, descent and landing (EDL). Despite their importance, presently there are only a few direct observations of winds on Mars, and indirect inferences are often imprecise. Because the Mars atmospheric dust cycle partially drive the wind fields, it is important to measure the dust and wind profiles simultaneously. It is ideal to measure them with the same instrument operating continuously, day and night, from a polar orbit. With support from an award from the Picasso program, we are presently developing a breadboard of a wind profiling lidar (called MARLI) to meet these needs. To date we have made considerable progress by: (a) leveraging the design of a single-frequency pulsed Nd:YAG laser from one now flying on CATS/ISS; (b) using a single solid etalon as a frequency resolver in the direct detection receiver, and (c) utilizing a highly sensitive 16-element HgCdTe APD detector from the ESTO IIP-10 program. We now we are assembling the instrument breadboard for measurement demonstrations. We have also updated our lidar performance/SNR models, which show better measurement performance than originally predicted. We plan to exit the Picasso program with the approach demonstrated from the ground, and accurate instrument performance model. The key components have TRLs from 3-5. For Mars we now have two approaches: one that measures along a single line of sight, allowing unidirectional measurements, as well as a dual beam/dual telescope approach that allows full vector measurements. Our approach is also flexible in wavelength and allows adding a frequency converter assembly to the laser. By operating at 2030 nm in the Titan atmosphere&#x19;s optical transmission window, this also allows measuring wind and aerosol backscatter profiles in the Titan atmosphere from orbit. Our planned work for MATISSE includes (a) further engineering the breadboard instrument into a brassboard, (b) demonstrating wind measurements (scalable to those from Mars orbit) to thin cirrus clouds from the ground, (c) and taking the key instrument assembly, the laser/telescope/receiver assembly, through vibration and TVAC tests. We will also demonstrate a version at 2030 nm for Titan and make wind measurements from the laboratory. We plan to propose a period of performance of 2 years, starting in April 2017. The component average Entry TRL is 4, and the Exit TRL of the key components will be 6.",

      "description": "We propose to overcome some of the limitations of current technologies for Mars exploration and even extend current operational capabilities by introducing the concept of a vacuum airship. This concept is similar to a standard balloon, whereas a balloon uses helium or hydrogen to displace air and provide lift, a vacuum airship uses a rigid structure to maintain a vacuum to displace air and provide lift. A vacuum airship made of a homogenous material cannot withstand the atmospheric pressure on Earth for any material humans have yet discovered, which can be proven using the critical buckling load of a sphere. However, from an initial analysis of the vacuum airship structure and relationship to atmospheric conditions, Mars appears to have an atmosphere in which the operation of a vacuum airship would not only be possible, but beneficial over a conventional balloon or dirigible. In addition, a multi-layer approach, in conjunction with a lattice, would circumvent the buckling problems of a single homogenous shell. The lattice used to support the two layers of the vacuum airship shell can be made, using modulation of the lengths of the members, to fit the curvature of the vacuum airship precisely by following an atlas approach to the modulation. The Martian atmosphere has a pressure to density ratio that is very beneficial to the operation of a vacuum airship; this is a result of the high average molecular weight of the atmosphere (relative to other planets in the solar system) and the temperature of the atmosphere, the trend for which can be observed from the ideal gas law. Through a more in-depth analysis of the vacuum airship model, it can be shown that the vacuum airship may theoretically carry more than twice as much payload as a modeled dirigible of the same size, a 40-meter radius, in the Martian atmosphere. A vacuum airship would be a valuable design for a vehicular probe for Mars. There are far fewer obstacles for an aerial vehicle as compared to a land vehicle such as existing Mars rovers, e.g. one need not worry about the vacuum airship getting stuck in a trench or being unable to traverse terrain. The vacuum airship could be used as a communication relay for other vehicular probes on Mars thereby overcoming line of sight constraints. If the vacuum airship is damaged, it can land, be repaired, and re-evacuated to resume operation, whereas a balloon would need to have gas pumped back into the vessel. Since the vacuum airship does not use a lifting gas, it can perform a near infinite number of compensation maneuvers to adjust or stabilize its altitude in a temperature variant environment. The vacuum airship could use its structure to protect the instruments from solar radiation and high energy particles. The vacuum airship probe would be able to traverse a much greater area of the planet in a smaller amount of time because there is no need to worry about getting stuck, and the vacuum airship can also observe a greater swath of land by rising in elevation. Even though the vacuum airship would be aerially base, the vehicle would still be able to touch down and perform tasks on the ground; it is even possible the vacuum airship could be used to transport ground probes to different locations. As far as energy is concerned, the large surface area of the vacuum airship would provide plenty of area for solar cells which would allow the vehicle to gather a large amount of solar energy without any additional structure, and once the airship is evacuated, the only energy it requires is for propulsion which can be accomplished by electric motors, unlike helicopters and airplanes which require energy to be devoted to lift.",

Proving a propellant production plant that can process the Martian atmosphere (and soil) will provide engineers with performance and operational control data that can be used for designing next generation and flight systems for future missions. Martian atmospheric gases are a very important resource for surface missions on the red planet. However, their utilization for the production of hydrocarbons, oxygen, and water into in situ resource utilization (ISRU) systems requires that they be separated from their original mixture. Trace gases must be extracted to provide pure carbon dioxide (CO2) to processing reactors. In addition, other Martian gases, such as nitrogen and argon, occur in concentrations high enough to be useful as buffer gas and should be captured as well. To achieve these goals, highly efficient gas separation processes will be required. These gas separation techniques are also required across various areas within the ISRU project to support various consumable production processes. &#x1c;Living off the land&#x1d; with resources indigenous to a planetary body such as Mars, or ISRU, requires mission-enabling capabilities that will be a necessary part of further exploration of the solar system.

      "description": "This proposal most directly relates to the Planetary Science/Exobiology goals that seek to understand the origin of life. It ties as well to the broader exobiology program in the Benner lab, which exploits models for origins to guide the search for Darwinism in the Solar System, constructs &quot;alien&quot; genetic systems to understand the range of possible biosignatures, and models the evolution of terran life working back in time to define an &quot;end goal&quot; for origins work. Thus, this work will have impact beyond simply elaborating an important model for the origins of life. Indeed, some of chemistry that we develop could be occurring on Mars today. The experimental work is organized around the &quot;RNA First&quot; model for the origin of Darwinism. It builds on the &quot;Discontinuous Synthesis Model&quot; (DSM) for the prebiotic formation of RNA. The DSM, in turn, is set in an explicit model for early planetary history, including a model for forming the &quot;late veneer&quot;, models for the redox potentials of the mantle and atmosphere at the time when life emerged, and models for minerals available in such environments. We then identify individual challenges remaining in the DSM that must be resolved before it can be accepted by the community as one possible solution to the &quot;origins&quot; conundrum. We then propose experiments, with alternatives to manage pitfalls, to resolve them. The work benefits from seed money provided by the Templeton Foundation, which (together with NASA support) led to multiple discoveries that will be developed. We discovered: (1) A spectrum of carbonate, sulfate, and silicate minerals that adsorb and stabilize RNA, often with a Periodic Table trend; one chiral mineral (quartz) even distinguishes homochiral D-RNA and L-RNA. This discovery will be developed by studying other chiral minerals and mineral surfaces, quantitatively comparing RNA binding by competition experiments, and moving from binary minerals to ternary minerals in realistically complex geo-environments. (2) Volcanic sulfur dioxide provides a simple way to get stable reservoirs of formaldehyde and other simple carbohydrates; these complement borate-carbohydrate minerals that allow advanced species to accumulate in useful amounts. This work will quantitate equilibrium constants to assess the value of sulfonates in managing &quot;tar&quot; problems in carbohydrate prebiotic chemistry, assess their compatibility with other mineral species in realistic geo-environments, and possibly rescue proposals (e.g. of Sutherland) that require large amounts of these. (3) We hypothesize that molybdenum (+6) can complete the management of the &quot;tar&quot; problem for carbohydrates; experiments now show that it was available in the Hadean. We will assess its performance in realistically complex mineral environments, determine its compatibility with phosphate, borate, and other mineral anions, and study its redox interaction with ferrous, sulfite, and other reduced species. (4) Mineral-based processes using the Krishnamurthy polyphosphate amide allow formation of glycosidic bonds of nucleoside phosphates in desert environments; borate-mediated rearrangements give nucleoside 5&#x27;-phosphates. We will assess three approaches to make activated nucleoside phosphates available for oligomeric RNA formation, including alternative oxidation states of sulfur. We will then do &quot;big picture&quot; experiments, illustrating how Loeb&#x27;s &quot;silent discharge&quot; in a post-veneer atmosphere can produce sufficient HCN, HNCNH, and other products that, if rained into physical rock containing olivine, tourmaline, and other mineral species, generate an effluent that can lead to the formation of RNA after draining into a dry space under a CO2 atmosphere. Consistent with a NASA budget, this will start with a synthetic effluent with nucleobases likely made in geothermal regions exposed to formamide, cyanamide, and cyanoacetylene, with RNA products stabilized by absorption on minerals.",

      "description": "The objective of the proposed work is to increase the set of possible exploration and science missions on Mars by investigating the feasibility of flapping wing aerospace architectures in a Martian environment. The proposed architecture consists of a Mars rover that serves as a mobile base and a swarm of Marsbees. Marsbees are robotic flapping wing flyers of a bumblebee size with cicada sized wings. The Marsbees are integrated with sensors and wireless communication devices. The mobile base can act as a recharging station and main communication center. The swarm of Marsbee can significantly enhance the Mars exploration mission with the following benefits: i) Facilitating reconfigurable sensor networks; ii) Creation of resilient systems; iii) Sample or data collection using single or collaborative Marsbees. Key technical innovation includes the use of insect-like compliant wings to enhance aerodynamics and a low power design. High lift coefficients will be achieved by properly achieving dynamic similarity between the bioinspired insect flight regime and the Mars environment. Our preliminary numerical results suggest that a bumblebee with a cicada wing can generate sufficient lift to hover in the Martian atmosphere. Moreover, the power required by the Marsbee will be substantially reduced by utilizing compliant wing structures and an innovative energy harvesting mechanism. Because of the ultra-low Martian density, the power is dominated by the inertial power. A torsional spring mounted at the wing root to temporarily store otherwise wasted energy and reduce the overall inertial power at resonance. Whereas rotary wing concepts are much more mature in both design and control, these two innovations are uniquely suited to bioinspired flapping vehicles and provide flying near the Martian terrain as a viable means of mobility. From a systems engineering perspective, the Marsbee offers many benefits over traditional aerospace systems. The smaller volume, designed for the interplanetary spacecraft payload configuration, provides much more flexibility. Also, the Marsbee inherently offers more robustness to individual system failures. Because of its relatively small size and the small volume of airspace needed to test the system, it can be validated in a variety of accessible testing facilities. The proposed work combines expertise and talent from the US and Japan in a multidisciplinary program to address fundamental aspects of flapping wing flight in Martian atmosphere. The University of Alabama in Huntsville team will numerically model, analyze, and optimize a flapping flyer for Martian atmospheric conditions. The Japanese team will develop and test a micro flapping robot, uniquely designed and constructed for the low-density atmosphere on Mars. The hummingbird Micro-Air Vehicle (MAV), developed by the Japanese team is one of only a few robotic flappers in the world that can fly on Earth. The objective of Phase I is to determine the wing design, motion, and weight that can hover with optimal power in the Mars atmospheric condition using a high-fidelity numerical model and to assess the hummingbird MAV in the Mars conditions. The aerodynamic performance of the hummingbird MAV will be assessed in a vacuum chamber with the air density reduced to the Mars density. Systems engineering optimization will be performed as well for the entire mission. The maneuverability, wind gust rejection, take-off/landing, power implications, remote sensing, and mission optimization will be addressed in Phase II.",

      "description": "Proposed Research. We propose to mature a superconducting gravity gradiometer (SGG) that measures all six components of the gravity gradient tensor for future planetary missions. A new and innovative design, based on three decades of development (mainly funded by NASA), gives a potential sensitivity of 0.1 mE Hz^(&#x12;1/2) in the frequency band of 0.1 mHz to 0.1 Hz (1 E = 10^(-9) s^(-2)). The measurement band and sensitivity can be optimally tuned in-flight during the mission by changing the resonance frequency of the SGG, which allows measurements of both high-resolution static gravity field for geological and geophysical investigations and time-variable fields for atmospheric and climate studies from the same mission. Relevance to NASA. The present study would help advance several goals and questions stated in the Planetary Science Decadal Survey 2013-2022, including (1) Characterization of planetary interiors to understand how they differentiate and dynamically evolve from their initial state, (2) Determination of the nature and evolution of the geologic processes that have created and modified the Martian crust over time. Key parameters of atmospheric mass transport dynamics on Mars and Venus can be constrained via accurate monitoring of temporal changes in their gravity fields. The internal structure and dynamics of Mars and Venus can also be better characterized by measuring static gravity fields much more accurately than at present. In sample return missions to small bodies (like OSIRIS-Rex and CAESAR), the body&#x27;s gravity field must be surveyed from a relatively high orbit to enable a surface landing. Even from a high orbit, the SGG could greatly reduce gravity errors near the surface of the body. The SGG is a viable solution to reducing the cost, size and complexity of future planetary gravity missions, and thus accomplishing major programmatic goals of the Planetary Science Division. The SGG has a precision two orders of magnitude better than the electrostatic gravity gradiometer that was used on the GOCE mission and the atom-interferometer gravity gradiometers under development. The SGG requires only a single spacecraft and measures all components of the gravity gradient tensor and is more sensitive to short-wavelength gravity signatures compared to satellite-to-satellite tracking (SST). With its resonance frequency tuned to a lower frequency, the SGG is also competitive with the SST for long-wavelength signals. Proposed Methodology. The new SGG will employ three pairs of superconducting test masses, with their sensitive axes oriented orthogonal to each other. Each such pair is levitated on two precisely aligned superconducting tubes. By measuring differences in the motions of these test masses, using superconducting circuits, all six components of the gravity gradient tensor are simultaneously measured. Under PICASSO, a prototype single-axis SGG was constructed and demonstrated. Under MatISSE, we will develop a full-tensor SGG, and implement an in-situ axis alignment system by using persistent currents, which will enable common-mode rejection to 10^(&#x12;8). The SGG requires cooling to &lt;6 K, and the goal for a space mission is to use a cryocooler to enable a mission lifetime of 5-10 years. The most significant issue for such a mission has been the potential for vibration from the cryocooler to couple into the SGG. There are two candidate cryocoolers for a future SGG mission that have successfully mitigated vibration: Northrop-Grumman&#x27;s MIRI cryocooler and Creare&#x27;s turbo-Brayton cryocooler. TRL. In PICASSO, we constructed and tested a prototype single-axis SGG in the laboratory. The proposed tensor SGG for MatISSE is a combination of three single-axis SGGs with in-situ sensitive axis alignment capability. The entry TRL of this instrument for MatISSE is 4. We will advance the tensor SGG to TRL 5 by the end of the project, by demonstrating adequate performance while testing it under simulated cryocooler vibrations.",

Balloon-based Mars exploration has the capability to cover a larger portion of the Martian surface than is accessible via a rover and to provide better resolution than is available from satellites. Due to the low density of the Martian atmosphere, the balloon envelope for even a small payload is quite large (tens of meters in diameter); therefore, balloon deployment is a major challenge for a Mars balloon. A ground launched balloon, as compared to descent launched, allows a longer time constant for deployment, more control over the timing of the deployment, and, if coupled with a rover, also allows more control over the location of deployment. A challenge to ground deployment is the possibility of the envelope being damaged during deployment by winds, surrounding rocks, or parts of the associated lander. Aurora&#x27;s Shielded Mars Balloon Launcher (SMBL) concept addresses this challenge by using inflatable structures to provide a safe environment for balloon inflation and deployment.

However, predictive modeling approaches for the structural response of the TPS are currently missing. Modeling TPS structural response is a considerable challenge, since the structural response and possible failure of the TPS is tightly coupled to both the chemical processes (such as oxidation) occurring on the microstructure and the boundary layer aerothermodynamics (shear stress and heat flux). The goal of the proposed research is to develop a predictive modeling capability that couples thermochemical TPS response with its microscale thermo-structural response.

Combining revolutionary advances in dual frequency comb spectroscopy (DFCS) with the developed semiconductor mid-IR frequency comb, we will develop a powerful new tool for understanding the origin and evolution of the Solar System and habitability therein. This new in-situ measurement concept will provide a miniature and low power instrument for in-situ measurements of trace gas and stable-isotope compositions on the Moon, Venus, Mars, and Titan as well as such measurements on returned Martian, lunar, and cometary samples. Our team has recently demonstrated the first semiconductor-based mid-IR optical frequency comb by passive mode-locking an interband cascade laser (ICL)[1]. Our demonstrated ICL-based comb is the first true mode-locked semiconductor laser at mid-IR that can access 3-6 micrometer with broad coverage and high efficiency. However, we have identified the modal dispersion in these combs limit the stable operating conditions to a narrow range [2]. In this work, we propose to extend the emission bandwidth and stable operating conditions of the ICL combs by dispersion compensation engineering of the laser gain medium and the waveguide. The proposed optical frequency comb will span over 200 nm with a center wavelength at 3.3 micrometer. By taking advantage of a multi-heterodyne architecture where two nearly similar optical combs are interfered on an optical detector, we will enable a multi-species massively parallel optical detection scheme with part-per-billion (ppb) sensitivity at sub-second acquisition time [3]. Therefore, the proposed dual comb spectrometer is suitable for simultaneous detection of a series of target molecules such as CH4, H2S, N2O, NH3, C2H2, C6H6 (benzene) and many other volatile compounds. The innovative combination of high-efficiency ICL combs and small cavity dimensions will be applicable throughout the 3 to 6 micrometer range. The incumbent state-of-the-art in in-situ detection of planetary volatiles is GC-MS (mass spectrometry coupled with a gas chromatographic column). Typical detection limits of GC-MS instruments that are compatible with planetary exploration are approximately a few ppb to 10 ppb. Our proposed instrument will have comparable or better sensitivity. Moreover, IR spectroscopy is inherently compound-specific and isotope-specific, thereby eliminating isobaric interferences associated with mass-spectrometric techniques. Consequently, unlike mass spectrometry, our proposed DFCS instrument does not require sample preparation, pre-concentration, pre-separation (e.g. by gas chromatography), or pre-conversion, resulting in reduced instrument overhead and complexity and avoids issues associated with sample contamination and damage. The Decadal Survey [4] identifies specific goals and objectives for the New Frontiers Saturn Probe mission, that include determining the noble gas abundances and isotopic ratios of H, C, N, and O in Saturn&#x27;s atmosphere and determining the atmospheric structure at the probe descent location. In a Saturn Probe configuration, our proposed DFCS would be able to measure both Nitrogen/ammonia (lambda = 3.3 micrometer) and Carbon/methane (lambda = 3.27 micrometer) simultaneously where as other technologies such as tunable laser spectroscopy would require individual channels (2 lasers) for each gas under investigation.

      "description": "There are several ways to capture and pressurize CO2, including freezing at cryogenic temperatures, mechanical compression, and absorption. Completed studies on each approach, have generally favored cryogenic temperature and mechanical compression solutions. Recently, mechanical compression has gained momentum through the Mars Oxygen ISRU Experiment (MOXIE), which utilizes an Air Squared compressor for mechanical compression of CO2. If this approach is pursued further for a larger system, there are still several questions concerning reliability over 10,000 hours of autonomous operation in Mars environment and scalability. Air Squared plans on addressing these issues as part of Phase I. Air Squared proposes the development of a Multi-Stage Scroll Compressor (MSSC) that will be configured to support a store-and-utilize strategy (high pressure) or a collection-only strategy (high flow). If a store-and-utilize approach is required, the MSSC will be set up to pressurize the gas over the triple point (&gt;77 PSIA), which provides the ability to liquefy CO2 downstream of the MSSC as it cools, while N2 and Ar remain a gas. If only collection is necessary, the MSSC will be configured to maximize flow at a pressure above 15 PSIA. There will be two &#x27;types&#x27; of MSSCs pursued during the Phase I, an orbiting and spinning MSSC. The orbiting MSSC has the advantage of longer design heritage and lowers associated risk, as this scroll configuration is widely used at Air Squared and the compressor industry as a whole. The spinning MSSC has the advantage of achieving an aggressive size and weight target but has little design heritage. The orbiting MSSC and spinning MSSC both have substantial advancement over state of the art mechanical compression technologies, such as high-speed turbo-compressors. Size, weight, and power requirements are all reduced. Reliability is also improved, as both MSSCs operate at significantly lower speeds than turbo-compressors.",

      "description": "As human exploration moves deeper into space, it becomes critical to acquire supplies from the environment in-situ. NASA has identified oxygen, water, and methane as the most critical assets that could be acquired by means of in-situ resource utilization (ISRU). Given that the Martian atmosphere is 95.9% CO2, atmospheric processing is the most feasible ISRU method of producing O2, H2O, and CH4. The MOXIE experiment is underway to demonstrate in-situ production of O2 for propellant and for breathing on Mars (Mars 2020 Rover). The gas produced by ISRU CO2 processing needs to be &quot;completely dry&quot; for cryogenic liquefaction, as traces of residual water can impede the efficiency of cryogenic storage and combustion, but commercial technologies for monitoring traces of water in &quot;dry&quot; gases are too bulky and complex for use in space or on Mars. Intelligent Optical Systems (IOS) will develop a compact humidity monitor to detect low ppmv of water in oxygen and methane, designed to meet the requirements for space exploration and operation in combustible environments. The proposed monitor will incorporate a novel luminescent sensor element, which consists of a luminescent indicator dye highly sensitive to water vapor, immobilized in a polymer support. The optical technique is time-based, which gives it excellent reliability and accuracy, and avoids the drawbacks of intensity-based measurements. IOS has developed and delivered humidity sensors for NASA space suit development programs, demonstrating operation in oxygen, nitrogen, and other gases, and has demonstrated that it can monitor low ppm of water. In Phase I, we will demonstrate a novel sensitive element for detecting low ppm of water, focusing on sensitivity, measurement range, and minimal or no maintenance on long term missions.

Lithium hydroxide (LiOH) canisters have impractical logistics penalties, and regenerable metal oxide canisters weigh too much.

The key difference in this application will be aimed at minimizing the resource requirements to still achieve the unique and important science goals for Mars (and other planetary atmospheres) enabled by a fast-response, high-precision wind sensor such as a sonic anemometer. In particular, we propose to test several candidate transducer technologies that we expect will perform well under Martian conditions, and require significantly less power, mass, and cost to implement for a space flight application. Prior PIDDP efforts have demonstrated that a Martian Sonic Anemometer can be built and can achieve the performance requirements to enable boundary layer eddy sensing and the significant scientific benefits that follow, addressing many key questions identified in the Planetary Decadal Survey. Mars2020 proposal efforts defined the resulting instrument to require ~7W of power and ~1.3kg of mass. It was developed around cumbersome, high voltage transducers and a complicated, computationally intensive signal processing scheme. We aim to reduce these resource requirements by more than half in power (i.e., ~&lt;3W) and somewhat less in mass (~0.75kg) using transducers from a new source, and simplifying the signal processing technique (but retaining adequate performance). We will test several candidate transducer technologies and then mature the most promising of those to optimize its eventual use in space flight at Mars (and other planetary atmospheres). We will develop instrument back-end electronics to prove our simplified signal processing technique. Because of the un-proven state of the new transducers, and the signal processing approach, this instrument is currently at TRL 3. We expect to mature this project up to TRL 5 by the end of the proposed 3 year time span, depending on our success with the transducer maturation. This places this project within the appropriate TRL starting point for PICASSO. Our proposed effort would mature an instrument that could find application on near-term upcoming missions to Mars, as well as potential missions to other planetary bodies with atmospheres (e.g., Venus, Titan, and Earth).

In the LSP, propanol is cooled to temperatures below -100 C, where it becomes an effective solvent for Mars atmospheric CO2. After absorbing 5 percent or more by mole CO2, the propanol is pumped to another vessel where it is heated to 30 C, releasing the CO2 at pressures of more than 1 bar. The clean warm propanol is then sent back to the absorption vessel, exchanging heat with the cold absorption column effluent as it goes. After the clean propanol is cooled to near the design absorption temperature in this way, a mechanical refrigerator is used to achieve the final temperature reduction. Advantages of the LSP are that it can operate continuously day or night without the need for mechanical vacuum roughing pumps, solid freezers, or large sorption beds, requires less power than other options, is readily scalable to high outputs, and that it stops all sulfur, dust, or non-condensable gases from reaching the ISRU reactor system.

      "description": "For billions of years, Bacteria and Archaea have formed organized communities in microbial mats. Such cooperation among microbes has played determinative roles in the persistence of life, and provides insight into how life on Earth and elsewhere may respond to and evolve in extreme conditions. A key cooperative mechanism among cells in high density habitats is quorum sensing (QS) using cell-to-cell signals. Genetic evidence suggests QS evolved 3.4 GYA, and was likely important during life&#x27;s early evolution when extreme environments prevailed. However, QS has not been explored in an astrobiology context, nor in astrobiologically relevant extreme environments, where deep branching microbial lineages thrive. This paucity of data presents a critical knowledge gap. We propose to investigate QS in microbial mats in hypersaline systems and lava caves, both analogs of habitats believed to have been present on early Earth and Mars; both also host deep-branching Archaea and Bacteria. Our main hypothesis is that QS signaling contributes to microbial-survival and resiliency under multiple extreme conditions. We will focus specifically on genetic components of QS, and how they drive gene expression during changing extreme conditions. Doing so will establish a solid foundation for understanding QS in mats in extreme environments, analogs of which thrived in early life on Earth. QS is a fundamental life process leading to higher organization and also a critical pathway through which microbes tolerate and adapt to environmental extremes similar to those that prevailed on early Earth and Mars. Objective 1: QS occurs in extreme environments: hypersaline mats and Hawaiian lava caves. H1: QS occurs among phylogenetically diverse Bacteria and Archaea in extreme environments. Acylhomoserine lactones (AHLs) are well-studied signaling molecules that confer important metabolic properties on microbes, but their diversity and activities in microbes in extreme environments are poorly understood. AHL signaling comprises a conserved AHL and a receptor protein (i.e., luxR homolog). Our preliminary data show the presence of AHLs in hypersaline mats. However, additional work is needed to determine if AHL-based QS systems are common in microbial communities in extreme environments. We will investigate genetic bases of AHL-QS and phylogenetic diversities of luxR homologs as possible mechanisms of adaptability in these communities. Objective 2: QS confers and enhances survivability under changing extremes in early Earth- and early Mars-like environments. H2: Both the types of signals used by Archaea and Bacteria and resulting gene expression, change as conditions (salinity, desiccation, UV) become more extreme. We posit from our preliminary results that certain signals are less susceptible to degradation than shorter-chain counterparts. We thus predict that cells will utilize more-resilient signals under harsh environmental conditions. This in turn will test the potential for life to adapt to changing environmental extremes, and its implications for life elsewhere. To do so, we will determine changes in levels of gene expression, concentrations and types of AHLs in natural, multi-species mats, and in isolates exposed to varying extreme environmental conditions (high UV CO2, desiccation, salinity) in both a Planetary Environmental Liquid Simulator (PELS) and controlled atmosphere chamber. Objective 3: AHL signals persist over time through extreme environmental changes. H3: QS signals are preserved under extreme conditions (high salinity, desiccation, UV). This contributes to recovery and persistence of cooperative processes in mats. Our preliminary studies show that extracellular osmolytes protect AHLs in natural hypersaline mats during desiccation and UV exposure. When more favorable conditions return, this may elicit community-wide recovery rather than just individual cell survival, and enhance community survival over long periods.",

The development of such a technology would allow for bridging of the gap between the robotic missions which we have successfully landed on Mars to date and the potential human class missions.

      "description": "Recent advances in wide-bandgap electronics has resulted in development of electronic circuits capable of operation in the high-temperature, corrosive environment of the Venus surface, leading to possibility of a future mission operating at the ambient temperature of Venus. However, the scientific instrumentation that would fly on such a mission still needs further development. In particular, it is highly desirable that any mission to the surface of Venus would include a camera, but designs for cameras that operate at temperatures of 450&#xb0;C do not currently exist. We propose to develop an integrated imaging array capable of operating for long periods of time (months) in the ambient Venus surface environment (740K, 92 bars). All conventional approaches to operating a camera on the surface of Venus have required a sealed vessel to thermally isolate a camera from the environment, most specifically from the external temperature. This requires a protected, insulated, and windowed vessel, and the heat leak from the Venus thermal environment necessarily results in an operational lifetime of at most a few hours before the system undergoes thermal failure. Such systems also incur the significant penalties of increased spacecraft mass (and power, if active cooling is used.) In contrast, our proposed approach is intended to provide an imager with an extended operating lifetime at Venus ambient temperature, consistent with other long-lived lander technologies currently under active development. The combination of high-temperature integrated circuits (consisting of amplifiers, logic gates, and analog-to-digital converters) with small, wavelength-appropriate photovoltaic diodes allows for the construction of a low-mass, low-power imaging photodetector array that is able to function continuously for timescales comparable to a Venus solar day (117 Earth days). Following the example of the Viking Mars lander cameras, this effort will start with the demonstration of a low-bandwidth, linear array scanning platform capable of gradually building up a high resolution, visible light panorama of a landing site through a simple actuation mechanism. We will leverage significant high-temperature, harsh environment expertise in designing and manufacturing electronic circuits, optical detectors and components, and actuators to enable a mission-enabling advance in imaging for Venus exploration and science. There is driving science need for such a capability. Of twenty-five missions to land on Venus, only four have resulted in images from the surface, where the most recent images were collected in 1982. Visual imagery at a microscopic and macroscopic scale have been transformational for Mars science, which demonstrates that contextual images of rock and regolith texture at the millimeter scale, and landing site geology/geomorphology at the kilometer scale, are critical tools for interrogating and understanding the history and current state of a planetary surface. The high temperature, pressure, and reactivity of Venus&#x27; near-surface atmosphere make it unfeasible to repurpose and adapt instruments with significant flight heritage for use outside a thermally and chemically protected shell, so this development effort under the PICASSO program is both appropriate and needed. The imaging system produced by this effort would be suitable for deployment on future Venus landers and rovers, with a lifetime long enough to observe transient surface phenomena and over time obtain a suite of microscopic context images that would facilitate small sample analysis of rock grains and minerals. Demonstration of such a proof-of-concept system with photodetectors, electronics, and basic actuation mechanisms will provide the basis for a revolutionary new avenue of Venus exploration.",

      "description": "The shallow martian subsurface is extremely interesting as a possible microbial habitat because there is evidence that it becomes temporarily wet, that it is shielded from radiation, and that mixing by aeolian processes might provide the energy and nutrients (chemicals) necessary for sustaining microbial life. We propose to mature the Martian Aqueous Habitat Reconnaissance Suite (MAHRS) to prepare it to study weathering processes and search for potentially habitable environments in the shallow subsurface of Mars and other planetary bodies. Aeolian abrasion is one of the most important currently active weathering processes on Mars. It also has important implications for habitability because, along with the transport of minerals by the wind, aeolian abrasion provides a means for the exchange of nutrients and energy sources between the atmosphere and the shallow subsurface. The growth of segregated ice and salt crystals in rock pores is a critical weathering process on Earth, and there is evidence that this process is currently active on Mars. Salts inhibit the exchange of moisture with the atmosphere and cement the soils of arid places such as MAHRS test sites--the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica, the Owens Dry Lake in California, and the Atacama Desert in Chile--and probably the regolith of Mars and of other arid planetary bodies. Salts have the potential to create pockets of wet regolith in the shallow martian subsurface that could be habitable and easily accessible by a robotic mission. Moisture cements the regolith, inhibiting saltation and reducing weathering by aeolian processes. MAHRS includes several sensors developed by our group during the past decade, including electric field sensors, optical microscopes, and radiometers developed to study saltation and dust transport. In addition, MAHRS includes a sensor to measure regolith wetness and to search for brines in the shallow subsurface, where they are more likely to be found. The measurements of regolith wetness and detection of brines have promise for shedding new light into aqueous weathering processes and habitability. In addition to maturing instruments developed by the MAHRS team over the last decade, the MAHRS project leverages Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) work. MAHRS responds to the top priorities of the 2013-2022 Decadal Survey and the 2007-2016 Science Plan for NASA&#x27;s Science Mission Directorate by maturing instruments for detecting potentially habitable zones in the shallow martian subsurface and for studying the exchange of matter between the atmosphere, the surface, and the shallow subsurface.

Consequently, significant propellant mass will be required. While it is technically feasible to generate O2 and CO propellants by electrolysis of CO2 from the Martian atmosphere, it will only work on bodies where there is significant CO2 in the atmosphere, and the mass of the required infrastructure (electrolyzer, batteries, solar panels) is substantial. A recent study showed that a hybrid rocket with multi-start capability trades more favorably than either a CO2 electrolysis system or a bipropellant system where the propellants are generated on Earth. Using a high-performance hybrid propellant combination and being able to restart the hybrid rocket are the keys. In previous and ongoing work, Ultramet has demonstrated that electrically heated open-cell silicon carbide foam can be used as an igniter for both monopropellant and bipropellant rocket engines. Due to its low mass, excellent oxidation resistance, and favorable electrical characteristics, the foam can be heated to 1300&#xb0;C in just seconds, which enables it to quickly ignite any propellant flowing through it. The Phase I project demonstrated that a foam heater could be turned on and off any number of times and that it was capable of heating oxygen and igniting paraffin. Applied to a portion of the oxidizer stream in a hybrid rocket engine, this will provide multi-start capability.

Manufacturing propellant from the Martian atmosphere would be far more practical. Highly efficient electrolyzers for splitting carbon dioxide into carbon monoxide (CO) and oxygen (O2) have been demonstrated. These can be run off solar power and used to generate high-pressure propellant without the need for pumps. With a theoretical vacuum specific impulse (Isp) of 324 sec (1000 psia chamber pressure, 40:1 nozzle expansion ratio), an O2/CO propulsion system would provide higher Isp than a solid rocket, and only a small fraction of the propulsion system wet mass would have to be brought from Earth. Previous testing with O2/CO propellant at NASA GRC has demonstrated that ignition of this mixture is very difficult. In that work, spark igniters were used, and every test resulted in a catastrophic detonation and damage to equipment. In this project, Ultramet will develop a high-performance ignition system for use with O2/CO propellant that is based on resistively heated silicon carbide open-cell foam. Previous testing has demonstrated that by passing an electric current through it, the foam can be heated to 1300 C in just 2 seconds. By flowing the non-hypergolic bipropellant mixture through the foam, ignition will take place in a pseudo-homogeneous manner as the gases enter the foam rather than only in the isolated vicinity of the arc in a spark igniter. This will prevent propellant accumulation in the chamber and subsequent detonation. Safe, reliable ignition of O2/CO is an enabling technology for the use of in-situ manufactured propellants on Mars.",

Brief description of the methodology: This proposal will augment a previously (and ongoing) Mars analog study site with two additional pieces of instrumentation: (1) MLS4 and (2) a set of multi-layer temperature sensors. We plan to extend the collection of field data from the previously funded instrumentation (sediment collectors and anemometers) to calibrate an algorithm to convert the MLS4 kinetic energy and particle count rates into sediment flux. We will monitor the atmospheric temperature profile to determine if thermal instabilities affect this calibration algorithm. Relevance of the proposed research: This proposal is relevant to two of the three areas of fidelity. Science: The Grand Falls dune field site is a local area (40 miles from the PI&#x27;s institution) with high winds, active dunes and a range of precipitation and temperatures. This proposal will continue the collection of an additional year of sediment flux measurements. This additional year of data will allow for the analysis of interannual variability. The additional instrumentation to measure the near-surface atmosphere temperature profile will help determine the air stability and compare that to sediment flux rates. Technology: This proposal will test the deployment, feasibility, and calibration of MLS4 as an instrument package to measure sediment flux rates with no moving parts. We will develop the necessary protocols and procedures that will be needed to calibrate the data under conditions when concurrent sediment collectors and wind observations are not available. This instrument package could either be deployed to Mars (or perhaps Titan) on a rover (e.g. as part of the mast) or as a lander.",

      "description": "OxEon Energy proposes a combination of materials and engineering solutions to demonstrate the reduction-oxidation (redox) stability of a solid oxide electrolysis cathode during start up and operation. The redox tolerant cathode material will reduce system complexity, tolerate flow upset conditions, and provide flexibility in space based systems without a man-in-the-loop. Solid oxide electrolysis stacks use nickel &#x13; zirconia composite cathode to reduce incoming oxidized species such as those available on Mars (e.g. carbon dioxide) to produce high purity oxygen. The device can also operate on co-electrolysis mode where the atmosphere CO2 and water and other volatiles from extra-terrestrial soils can be processed together to produce oxygen and fuels such as methane for propulsion, regenerative power, and life support system applications. Present state of the art electrolysis stacks use a nickel-zirconia composite cathode. Nickel based electrodes are susceptible to oxidation by the feed gas (CO2 or steam) at the inlet conditions unless reduced species (carbon monoxide or hydrogen) are also present. This necessitates a complex, recycle loop that introduces a fraction of the product gases to the inlet. Prior attempts at developing an oxidation resistant cathode evaluated precious metal or ceramic oxides. They exhibited excellent stability in CO2 and steam, but the performance of cells was significantly lower relative to nickel based electrode. The proposed cathode material is expected to be stable in an oxidizing environment with little or no deleterious oxidation. This will allow a significant simplicity in electrolysis system design, facilitate the utilization of in situ resources to produce oxygen and fuels, resulting in the development of an enabling technology for future manned mission to Mars.",

      "description": "It is clear from past mission studies that a manned Mars mission, as well as deep space planetary orbiters will require aerobraking and aerocapture which use aerodynamic drag forces to slow the spacecraft. Aerocapture would enable long term studies of the outer planets and their moons that would not be possible with existing braking technologies. While utilizing planetary atmospheres to slow down and capture spacecraft would dramatically reduce the cost, launch mass, and travel time, current technologies require significant additional spacecraft mass and risk, as the spacecraft must descend deep into a planetary atmosphere that is not well characterized in order to produce significant drag on a relatively small, fixed dimension aeroshell or temperature and structurally sensitive inflatable ballute. The Magnetoshell deploys a simple dipole magnetic field containing a magnetized plasma. It is interaction of the atmosphere with this magnetized plasma that supplies a significant impediment to atmospheric flow past the spacecraft, and thereby producing the desired drag for braking. Frictional heating would no longer be of concern as the energy dissipation required to slow the spacecraft would be deposited into the plasma ions helping to maintain the Magnetoshell plasma while at the same time shielding the spacecraft itself from frictional heating. With the aeroshell now being composed of massless magnetic field, the transverse scale of the magnetic barrier can be as large as 100 meters while requiring no more than a gram of plasma. With the ability to rapidly and precisely modify the drag in varying atmospheric conditions, much larger forces can now be achieved at low risk, enabling very aggressive aerocapture maneuvers. By providing power in a pulsed manner, the thermal and power processing requirements can be kept modest and with conventional technologies. In Phase I a full system was designed for Neptune and Mars missions. This analysis showed that a 200 kg, 2 m magnet could generate a 9 m radius Magnetoshell for Neptune aerocapture with a 21 km/s injection at a peak force of 150 N entirely removing the need for a TPS. At Mars, a 2.5 m magnet could generate a 21 meter radius Magnetoshell, providing aerocapture for a 60 metric ton payload removing the dedicated aerocapture TPS and saving $2 B for DRA 5.0. A transient analytic model was developed evolving the radial plasma parameters for a variety of plasma, neutral, and magnetic parameters. Finally, a stationary 1.6 meter argon Magnetoshell was fully demonstrated and a 1000:1 increase in aerodynamic drag was found. This experimental program definitively demonstrated a subscale Magnetoshell by eliminating electromagnetic interference, utilizing a dielectric torsional thrust stand, and placing all key electrical components under vacuum in the plasma environment. In addition, by decrease the dynamic pressure requirements while simultaneously shielding the spacecraft, heating during an Aerocapture maneuver could be reduced by 10,000X. In the proposed Phase II, the complete mission benefits of the Magnetoshell system will be proven. During this Phase II detailed mission studies will investigate the 3D orbital entry and capture mechanics while investigating the thermal, structural, electrical, and magnetic requirements of a Magnetoshell system. These studies will determine the risk, cost, and overall benefits of a full scale Magnetoshell aerocapture system for a range of science and manned missions to the inner and outer solar system. A hypersonic plasma-neutral interaction validation study will prove the fundamental particle and plasma effects at 10 to 15 km/s velocities and relevant densities. And finally, a detailed Aerocapture orbital gravity model, based on the satellite tour design program (STOUR) will be developed to model in 3D, the full dynamics of an interplanetary, 60 meter Aerocapture system.",

Pressure sensing has traditionally always drawn high interest from the military due to its applications to high-performance military airplanes and helicopters, missiles and ballons. Aerodynamics also find its applications in civilian aviation. After over 100 years of research and development, most powered aerodynamic experiments can be accurately simulated numerically on a computer today. However, aerodynamic experiments and measurements are still needed for the input parameters to the simulation, for the final verification of results and routine monitoring of performance. As a matter of fact, precision aerodynamic measurements gain ever higher importance today than before. There are 3 special challenges of measuring pressure on Mars: (1) the thin atmosphere requires high ensitrivity sensors; (2) the extreme temerature range; and (3) the survival of the landing impact. This proposal address them all. At home on the Earch, air pressure measurements reveal a lot of useful information about aircraft engine performance, about the air flow on aircraft wings, about the on-blade dynamic pressure of a helicopter, and about the optimal design and motion of a parachute among other things. The unique advantage of our solution lies in its high stability against temperature variations and mechanical disturbances, rendering the proposed system rugged and robust enough for Mars landing and exploration while keeping the cost at the level of commercial off the shelf fiber-optic communications systems. In Phase I of this program, we propose to demonstrate a bench-top system with several high-sensitivity etalon pressure sensors with high temperature and mechanical stability. In Phase II, we will develop the complete pressure sensor system using existing fiber optic components with monitoring and feedback control software.",

The near-infrared (1-5 um) emission of planets, moons, comets and asteroids is rich in information, including gas composition and surface mineralogy. We propose to develop a next-generation near-infrared spectrometer for future planetary missions, based on integrated photonics technology. In this PICASSO, we will build a fully-operational instrument prototype focused on the CO spectral band at 4.6-4.8 um, which is of key importance to cometary science. Successor instruments can be modified straightforwardly for spectroscopy of the nearby bands of CO2, H2O, CH4 for wide applicability in planetary science, by changing the reference laser. This technology development and demonstration will provide an important proof of concept for future flight instruments. Methodology: We will design, build and test a compact, high efficiency coherent (heterodyne) optical spectrometer with associated electronics to combine and leverage recent technological breakthroughs by the proposing team and others. Our spectrometer takes advantage of three significant advances in the field of photonics in recent years &#x13; (a) photonic lantern (PL) technology for astronomy; (b) arrayed waveguide gratings (AWGs); and (c) photonics integrated circuits (PIC) for the telecommunication industry. The PIC allows the complex integration of electro-optics components, including AWGs and local oscillators for heterodyne detection, in a compact form factor that will provide smaller, lighter, and lower-power instrumentation. We will leverage the significant earlier progress by our team members at NRL and UCSB toward high-performance near-infrared (NIR) laser arrays integrated on a silicon (Si) chip. During the 3-year performance period we will (i) develop key components and subsystems; (ii) integrate sub-systems to build a complete instrument; (iii) demonstrate and validate high sensitivity measurements in conjunction with our existing infrastructure and instrumentation. The entrance TRL for this instrument is 2, which will be raised to 4 on completion.

      "description": "The purpose of this technology development task is to develop a new air purification system based on a liquid membrane, capable of purifying carbon dioxide from air in a far more compact and energy efficient system than what is currently possible. The approach relies on recent advances in supported liquid membranes, which allow the manufacture of mechanically stable, ultra-thin supported liquids that have permeability and selectivity for carbon dioxide over one order of magnitude greater than existing approaches. Most critically, because these membranes use a liquid as an active material, it is possible to electrochemically pump the carbon dioxide, making it viable to build an air purification system that uses no mechanical components such as compressors. Such an innovation has the potential to dramatically improve NASA&#x27;s capabilities for human missions to Mars and other long-term space habitation applications. Life support systems on human spacecraft are designed to provide a safe, habitable environment for the astronauts, and one of the most significant challenges is managing acceptable air quality. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is an important trace gas produced by human metabolism that must be actively removed from spacecraft cabin atmosphere. The Carbon Dioxide Removal Assembly (CDRA) currently on board the ISS performs the carbon dioxide (CO2) removal function as part of the on-board Atmosphere Revitalization System (ARS). It is considered the state-of-the-art for manned spacecraft cabins, but has two significant drawbacks: 1. The CDRA requires that air be dried prior to CO2 capture, and this costs energy &#x13; in fact, the system uses much energy drying the air than is required for capturing and releasing carbon dioxide. 2. The CDRA works in batch mode, requiring complicated valving and control to switch between sorbing and desorbing beds, while downstream CO2 processing systems can operate on a continuous stream of CO2. This adds unnecessary complexity, as well as a second parasitic energy loss. An ideal system would process CO2 continuously without any need for drying of the air, and without any moving parts. Such a system would require a fraction of the size and weight of the CDRA while dropping the cost of CO2 capture by 5X or more. Such a technology would be enabling for future long term manned flight missions, such as a mission to Mars. This element is developing a new electrochemical membrane technology using patented innovations in electrolyte materials. Technology development began under a Phase I effort funded by the NASA Advanced Innovative Concepts Program. The prior Phase I effort demonstrated the functionality of the basic approach to CO2 separation, demonstrating CO2 removal using only electrical input using a film in a membrane configuration. Membrane synthesis and fabrication techniques were developed that allowed for the successful incorporation and retention of an electrochemically active carrier molecule using composite liquid membrane technology. This allowed for the successful demonstration of a continuous CO2 capture rate at 40% in a single step with no moving parts. A higher capture rate of 80% was demonstrated in a batch mode during this phase. The work gave promise that highly efficient, low energy separation of CO2 was possible using this technology, with the potential of operational energy savings as high as 80% compared with the state of the art, together with a weight and size footprint that could be as much as 75% smaller. The key enabling technology &#x13; composite liquid membrane materials &#x13; allow creation of a functional electrochemical membrane in a thin film form factor that enables this technology and application. This prior work, however, demonstrated CO2 from nitrogen gas only, not humidified air. It will be a technical challenge to prove the concept in representative cabin atmosphere containing moisture and oxygen. This Element, representing Phase II tasks, will focus on modifying the composite membrane system, evaluating active carrier molecules, ionic liquid solvents and membrane properties to operate the system efficiently in humid air. Reliability and performance of the system will be evaluated. Finally, a subscale system for a prototype air purifier will be designed. The effort will include increasing the size of the test cell and demonstrating long-term operation of the membranes under simulated cabin air (oxygen and nitrogen mixture with moisture), consistent with NASA requirements.",

We will prepare the task-specific 3rd generation ILs and then measure their electrochemical properties; i.e., conductivity, electrochemical window, etc. These are currently unknown but are important in order to ascertain whether these ILs are suitable for this application. Anticipating this will be the case, we will then test various electrodes, including TiO2 and silver cathodes, to determine which gives the most selective reduction of CO2 to methane. The efficiency of the process (including power requirements) will be quantified and compared to the Sebatier and Fischer-Tropsch processes.",

      "description": "The development of robust and efficient Entry, Descent and Landing systems fulfill the critical function of delivering payloads to planetary surfaces through challenging environments. Future NASA missions will require new technologies to further space exploration and delivery of high mass loads. Of particular interest is the development of reusable hot structure technologies for primary structures exposed to extreme heating environments on atmospheric entry vehicles. A hot structure system is a multifunctional structure that can reduce/eliminate the need for a separate thermal protection system. Thus, there is a need for the development of new technologies to support the realization of low-cost, durable/reusable hot structures applicable to atmospheric entry vehicles. A key barrier is the requirement for the lightweight form to not only carry mechanical loads but also accommodate high temperatures (1000-2200&#xb0;C), severe transient heating, and temperature gradients through the thickness. Novel materials and associated fabrication processes are needed to balance the demand for structural cohesiveness with desired thermal properties required to protect structure interiors. Sporian Microsystems has developed advanced ceramic materials for harsh environments with a particular focus on materials technologies based on ultra-high temperature polymer derived silicon carbonitride (SiCN). The long-term objective of this proposed work is to heavily leverage prior preceramic precursor based insulating materials development, and revise processes that can be used to realize hot structure systems. The PhI effort will focus on assessing candidate processes and SiCN precursor formulation to create relevant load-bearing, insulating structures, then demonstrating technical feasibility by producing and testing hot structure samples. If successful, Sporian will be well prepared for Phase II efforts focused on producing demo units for NASA testing and addressing vehicle integration.",

The AMWAS removes water from Mars soils using hot, recirculating carbon dioxide gas to provide rapid heat transfer. The AMWAS evaporates water from ice and salt hydrates, leaving dissolved contaminants in the soil residue. The water distilled from the extraction vessel is condensed, treated with activated carbon to remove residual volatiles and organic material, filtered to remove suspended solids, and subjected to deionization in preparation for proton exchange membrane electrolysis. Recuperative heat exchange is employed to minimize heat losses from recirculating carbon dioxide gas. Cold temperatures of the Mars atmosphere are used to facilitate condensation and separation of water from recycled carbon dioxide gas. A vacuum jacket is used to minimize heat losses from the extraction vessel. Much of the net heat input to the AMWAS can be supplied by solar concentrators or waste heat from radioisotope thermoelectric generators. The AMWAS vessel is equipped with a single, stationary seal that facilitates materials handling automation and minimizes potential leakage over the nominal operating period of up to 480 days.",

A central piece to this research will be the methodology and algorithm to integrate the entry and powered descent guidance algorithms during EDL operations. There is strong evidence in current EDL research that points to significant propellant saving for planetary missions if the entry trajectory can be shaped for the powered descent guidance to take advantage. One of the challenges is how to best accomplish this collaboration between entry and powered descent guidance in an onboard environment based on the actual condition. This research will develop an algorithm capable of onboard determination of the trajectory and guidance commands necessary for entry, based on the actual state and selecting an appropriate condition for powered descent initiation (PDI). It is intended to deliver an algorithm with onboard capability based on the actual condition and not requiring complex algorithms or functions other than the ones already available for entry and powered descent guidance. In addition, admitting the flexibility to operate under diverse atmospheric conditions benefits exploration missions to the Moon, Mars, or other planets. These capabilities, along with the development of the new integrated algorithm, will allow engineering groups at NASA the potential advantages of implementing this algorithm and see if current systems can be updated for future space missions. The results obtained from this research have potential implications in the design of future spacecraft guidance control for deep space exploration. These results will help identify potential solutions to propellant efficiency problems during the entry phase. Currently, it is very important to take advantage of our resources intelligently. By exploring different scenarios and discovering the most efficient ones for propellant usage, resources can be allocated efficiently, and mission cost can be greatly reduced. In doing this, it will be possible to demonstrate that more powerful and efficient guidance algorithms can be created that can help reduce the cost of space exploration to plan longer and more complex missions. The addition of both algorithms will benefit NASA&#x27;s goal of creating new and innovative space technologies to explore and understand the Earth and our solar system. By improving current capabilities, our leadership in space exploration is being maintained and focus on newer technologies that will expand our knowledge of the solar system are encouraged. By sharing these results to the science community through presentations at conferences, I hope to motivate other researchers to develop new technologies that advance space exploration.",

      "description": "Trioctahedral Fe(II) smectites are dominant basalt alteration products under anoxic conditions. On modern Earth, the top 600 m of oceanic crust contains 6-10 vol.% Fe(II) smectites, with shallow portions partially oxidized through seawater interaction. Prior to oxygenation of Earth&#x27;s atmosphere and oceans, such clays would also have occurred in soils on land and as detrital minerals in riverine, lacustrine, and marine settings. In marine environments alone the estimated crustal pool of Fe(II) in smectites is two orders of magnitude larger than the dissolved Fe(II) pool predicted for Archaean seawater. Fe(II) smectites have recently been identified on Mars in ~3.5 Ga mudstones deposited in a redox-stratified lake in Gale Crater. In addition, these likely occur throughout the solar system wherever water alters mafic rocks, including on subsurface oceans on icy moons like Europa and Enceladus. The role that Fe(II) smectites play in biogeochemical iron cycling has been largely unexplored to date because their modern occurrence is restricted to subsurface, anoxic settings. Trioctahedral Fe(II) smectites are thus a massive, yet under-examined, Fe(II) pool potentially available for use as electron donors in early microbial metabolisms and on other habitable planetary bodies. It remains unclear whether chemolithotrophic or photoferrotrophic microorganisms are capable of using trioctahedral Fe(II) smectites as electron donors, what enzymatic mechanisms are involved in this oxidation, how the chemical and structural properties of these smectites affect their viability as electron donors, and whether such processes leave signatures in the rock record. We propose to assess the ability of iron-oxidizing bacteria to use trioctahedral Fe(II) smectites as electron donors and to identify the mineralogical and chemical signatures of such metabolic activity. Specific objectives include to: (1) Constrain the chemical and biological mechanisms of trioctahedral Fe(II) smectite oxidation by chemolithotrophs and photoferrotrophs; (2) Identify the mineralogical products of microbial and abiotic Fe(II) smectite oxidation; and (3) Assess trace metal signatures of microbial oxidation of Fe(II) smectites. A series of Fe(II) smectites will be synthesized, with a subset containing oxidizable [V(III), Mn(II), Co(II)] and non-oxidizable [Ni(II), Cu(II), Zn(II)] trace metals. Known cultures of chemolithotrophic and photoferrotrophic iron oxidizing bacteria will be used to investigate microbial oxidation of Fe(II) smectites. Diffraction, imaging, and spectroscopic techniques will determine how Fe oxidation state and smectite structure is altered by microbial and abiotic oxidation. Transcriptomic and RT-qPCR experiments will assess the enzymatic mechanisms involved in aqueous Fe(II) versus smectite Fe(II) oxidation. Collectively, these measurements will provide an understanding of the biological, mechanistic, and structural controls on microbial Fe(II) smectite oxidation. The products of smectite oxidation and the effect of microbial oxidation on the distribution and oxidation state of structurally-bound trace metals will be determined to assess potential mineralogical and chemical signatures. The proposed research will reveal whether an abundant mineral host of Fe(II) on the surface of the early Earth that also occurs widely on other planetary bodies can be used as an electron donor in diverse metabolisms involved in iron cycling. The proposed research addresses the goal of the Exobiology program in the focus area &quot;Early Evolution of Life and the Biosphere&quot; by examining biological utilization of mineral forms of the redox-active element iron expected to have been common on the early Earth. The planned project also addresses the goals of the focus area &quot;Biosignatures and Life Elsewhere&quot; by characterizing detectable mineralogical and compositional signatures associated with microbial oxidation of clays on the early Earth and other planetary bodies.",

It dates back to NASA&#x19;s Viking Program. In order to enable future exploration missions featuring sophisticated robots and safely land heavier spacecraft on Mars, this technology must be advanced to a new level of performance at supersonic speeds. For this purpose, larger than before high-speed parachutes and inflatable drag devices are needed. For a number of reasons ranging from cost to technical considerations, the design, development, and maturing of such devices for future use at Mars cannot be performed by relying only on tests. These tasks need assistance from predictive simulations based on a high-fidelity, multi-disciplinary computational model for parachute inflation dynamics and drag prediction. The development of such a model is a formidable challenge, as this model must be able to predict various instabilities of a parachute such as flutter and pulsation which can be encountered in the supersonic regime, and assess the influence on its performance of several factors such as material and geometric porosities, the relative size of its forebody with respect to its diameter, its distance from the forebody, the shape of the forebody, the line length, canopy design, and the Mach number. It must also be able to predict the influence of temperature and strain rate on the stress field a parachute can experience in the supersonic regime. In short, the development of such a computational model requires a number of innovations whose development constitutes the objective of the proposed effort. The expected outcome of this effort is a state-of-the-art modeling and simulation capability that will improve the design and performance of supersonic parachutes for Mars landing and save costs by reducing testing.",

The Earth-Mars Decelerator has its foundation with the Drag Brake concept as an alternative approach to safely returning astronauts from orbit. There are three important innovative features of the Drag Brake that distinguish its benefits. First, the use of a large umbrella-like shape forces vehicle slowdown at the higher atmospheric altitudes essentially reducing the heating rate so much that it eliminates the need for a heavy thermal protection system. Second, the ability to modulate the lift and drag behavior by reorienting the drag brake at the lower altitudes permits more precise landing locations and slower landing speeds. Third, carbon-based material choices and structural designs (as opposed to stainless steel materials) provide lighter and stronger decelerators with appropriate surface emissivity and anti-oxidative coatings. In addition to these three features, the new Drag Brake concept also has the following additional beneficial characteristics. Flexible Decelerator has never demonstrated in re-entry flight. This is a unique program goal. Blunt shape aerodynamically stable through entire re-entry flight regime.

The development of Micro unmanned air vehicles (MAVs) and Mars aircraft has received considerable attention recently. Unlike conventional aircraft, MAVs and Mars aircraft suffer from operation in an extremely low Reynolds number flight regime. Generally, a low Reynolds number is considered to be between 150,000 and 500,000. Both MAVs and Mars aircraft, however, can have operational Reynolds number regimes from 20,000 to 120,000. At these extremely low Reynolds numbers, the aerodynamic flow features are dominated by laminar separation and separation bubble effects, which are highly unstable and very dependent upon the free-stream conditions and atmospheric turbulence. Although it is often argued that an exploratory vehicle will operate over a benign portion of the flight envelope, an encounter with strong winds or gusts, particularly during a maneuver, could excite a highly non-linear response. This means that the assumption of linear derivatives for stability and control may not be valid, which could cause the loss of a vehicle designed with a control system based on linear assumptions. It is proposed that a low-cost, integrated ground test, simulation, and flight control development environment be created to address these challenges.",

      "description": "THE GOAL TO BE ADDRESSED is discovery of subsurface water on the Moon and Mars, in both orbital and lander missions. THE APPROACH AND METHODOLOGY TO BE USED TO ADDRESS THE GOALS is the development of a compact, robust, low-power and low-voltage neutron detector with velocity and energy resolution. Neutron detection is a proven technique for identifying planetary subsurface water. Due to their 15-minute lifetime, neutrons are absent as background in cosmic rays or solar neutron wind. Any neutron found near a planetary body has been produced by cosmic-ray spallation of planetary matter and thereby carries signatures of its birthplace. The energy spectrum of planetary neutrons reveals the presence of hydrogen. Spallation neutrons are born at MeV energies; those found with meV energies have been thermalized by hydrogenous planetary matter. Neutrons pass easily through most materials, so subsurface water can be a source of thermal neutrons. Indeed, thermal neutron detection is the only generally applicable technique for finding water within a solid matrix. Neutron detectors (NDs) have been incorporated in planetary missions for this very purpose. Based on helium-3 proportional counters, these detectors have demanding operational overheads, such as high voltage, high gas pressure, large mass and bulky shielding. They also have limited resolution of neutron energies and directions, which are critical to locating an unknown hydrogenous deposit. We have brought to TRL 2 a novel ND that overcomes these limitations. It is a network of compact low-overhead detector cells with diverse direction and energy resolution; it replaces the high-voltage proportional-counter electronics of present NDs with modern silicon photomultipliers operating at 28-volts. Optical detection also has a higher intrinsic bandwidth than the electric-discharge detection using proportional counters. The high-pressure helium-3 of present NDs is replaced by a micron-thick boron-10 thin film deposited on a silicon chip, embedded in atmospheric-pressure xenon. We have demonstrated neutron detection with a protoype in a sealed cubical physics package of volume 5 cm^3 and mass of 10 g. All power, control and readout electronics are contained in a single control module powered by the USB bus. Power consumption in steady operation is about 30 mW. Experimental tests to date, supplemented by detailed modeling, suggest that this detector has neutron detection sensitivity and gamma rejection comparable to that of the LEND instrument, and superior energy and directional resolution. We propose to bring to TRL 4 a detector based on a cellular network of compact physics packages operated by a single control module. With appropriate moderators and cell alignment, correlation of signals across the network will sample the angular distribution of planetary leakage neutrons. OUR PROPOSED WORK IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE PLANETARY SCIENCE RESEARCH PROGRAM, because orbital remote sensing and in situ measurement of neutrons have proven to be important tools for planetary geochemistry research. Determining the quantity and vertical distribution of volatile species on and below the surface of planetary bodies is vital for understanding the primordial chemical inventory and subsequent evolution of planets. Due to unavoidable practical limitations, all early lunar mission neutron instruments could only deliver integrated data on detected fluxes, averaged over large energy ranges and escape angles from lunar surface. The first orbital neutron telescope (LEND - CSETN) had a low signal/noise ratio because background ions, electrons, photons, and scattered neutrons triggered neutron detector signals. Our instrument can provide detailed directionality and energy information of planetary leakage neutrons with high detection efficiency and low background signals. Its simple cellular architecture can be adapted to both orbital and lander missions.",

Beyond robotic missions today, NASA is investigating robots that have capabilities similar to humans, such as NASA&#x27;s research platforms Robonaut 2 (R2) and Valkyrie. Robots like R2 and Valkyrie could provide sustainable, persistent care of infrastructure and equipment while there are humans present and when not. A future robotic team could lay the groundwork for human arrival on Mars, freeing precious time for scientific mission goals. This proposal aims to design an interface and the technology necessary to formulate and plan for complex tasks on complicated, humanoid robots operating in space. An example of an application of such a system is in dormancy operations for long-term space exploration. In the future, an operator for a robot managing a habitat may need to accomplish some task, such as moving cargo from one module of the habitat to another. The operator would observe the robot, establish parameters and constraints of the plan, and request a plan. To exert finer control over the robot&#x27;s motions, the operator could add more complex constraints. The system would generate a plan that respects constraints, possibly drawing upon previous plans to suggest improvements, and then display the motion and relevant statistics to the operator for approval. If a problem occurs, the operator can rest assured that there is a contingency in place so that the robot can safely recover, and begin planning anew. To achieve this vision, many fields of active robotics research need to be drawn from. Foundational research must be done for disparate problems in robotics as to integrate them into a whole, usable system. Humanoid robots benefit from their form as they may utilize the same tools and environment as humans, but accounting for their formidable mechanical capability while planning is a hard task. To achieve tasks in spaces designed for humans, the robot must respect constraints imposed from the tools used and intrinsic details of the navigable space. Sampling-based constrained motion planners are a promising approach to solve problems of this nature. However, contemporary constrained motion planners do not generalize to arbitrary, complex combinations of constraints. To this end, the proposed work includes development of a rigorous mathematical model of general constraints that can be leveraged by a novel constrained motion planner for effective motion planning. For a robot to remain safe while executing motions, the inherent uncertainty in the world must be accounted for, through planning under uncertainty. This proposal will investigate integration of constrained planning with contingency planning, as to have readily available motions to bring the robot back to safety in the event of failure. For safety and accountability, operators must also have feedback from the planning process to iteratively refine and eventually approve motions for execution. Approved plans will then be stored for later reuse as to not repeat previous efforts, using experience-based planning and cloud robotic systems to synchronize robotic teams. Possible improvement of stored knowledge through geometric and optimal planning techniques will also be investigated. A robotic agent that could be accurately and safely commanded aligns significantly with NASA&#x27;s goals for autonomous agents and further long-term space exploration. Although this proposal focuses on humanoid robots in space operations, the ideas and techniques presented are general, and widely applicable to other systems that must plan and require human operation. Methods from this proposal could be applied to other systems such as configurable habitats, rovers, and assistive or household robotics back on Earth.",

      "description": "Robotic planetary exploration missions will need to perform in-situ analysis of rock and/or regolith samples or returning samples back to earth. Obtaining and delivering a sample can be a complex engineering problem, especially if it&#x27;s done autonomously thousands of miles away. To accommodate future missions, these subsurface access and sample handling technologies must be developed to meet a broad range of potential requirements, including a variety of rock or subsurface materials, rigorous sample preservation requirements, and the general problem of autonomous operation in the presence of dust and with limited resources. The one-to-three meter range has been identified as a critical regime for planetary exploration and while there has been some technology development in this regime, there is currently no proven flight-like approach to robotically achieving this depth through layers of challenging material from realistic roving or landed platforms. The Phase 1 research has resulted in proving the benefits of rotary-percussive drilling system as it pertains to breaking of formation and cuttings transport. The primary objective of the proposed effort is to develop, via testing in a simulated Mars environment, a breadboard one-meter sampling drilling system for acquiring a small volume of drilled cuttings and a core (if necessary) from a target depth on Mars. This project would build on the existing knowledge base of Mars drilling, and its particular strength lies with its capability of performing drilling tests under simulated Martian conditions of temperature and pressure and CO2 atmosphere. This is a component technology effort that includes the development of a rotary percussive drill head and a sampling lead drill string. Honeybee Robotics will leverage drill head development by utilizing voice coil percussive actuator technology developed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) for the Mars Science Laboratory Powder Drill.",

The Martian sample size is directly affected by the propulsion capabilities of the Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV) and innovations are sought to enhance propulsion capabilities of the MAV for functions including primary propulsion from the Mars surface, orbit insertion, and attitude control. The proposed constant-volume combustion rocket (CVC) propulsion technology will lead to 1) significant weight reduction and simplification; 2) reduced costs in the system components and ground servicing; 3) prolonged mission or systems lifetimes; 4) improved reliability; and 5) enhanced critical mission functions. The Constant Volume Combustion (CVC) engine is an innovative design that combines light weight, low pressure fuel tanks and operates at high chamber pressures. The CVC engine has nearly identical specific impulse as the constant pressure engine with the same mass flow and throat area, furthermore, the nozzle optimizes at the same area ratio. It has exceptional thrust-to-weight ratios, and the proposed bipropellant system meets Martian temperature requirements without heating or stirring. During Phase 1 we will demonstrate, through analysis, experimentation, and hot-fire testing, the feasibility of our proposed CVC engine as a credible candidate for Mars Ascent Propulsion. In Phase II, there will be an aggressive push towards flight-like hardware to ensure rapid maturation of the technology in order to meet the NASA mission goals.",

We specifically target usage on future interplanetary small platforms (e.g. smallsats, small landers). The chip spectrometer operates on the principle of heterodyne detection. Heterodyne spectrometers offer ultra-high spectral resolution, without bulky dispersive elements or moving parts, and shot-noise-limited SNR (signal-to-noise ratio). Moreover, the chip spectrometer utilizes microfabrication to produce on-chip arrays wherein each array element (pixel) is a heterodyne spectrometer. Depending on the measurement objective, these on-chip nano-spectrometers can be configured either as spatial imaging pixels to enable imaging, or as spectral pixels for increasing spectral coverage. The chip detector resides in the focal plane of a mini-telescope to detect sunlight that has propagated through the planetary atmosphere. Amplitudes of absorption lines observed in the sunlight indicate molecular abundances, while ratios between different rotational-vibrational lines indicate atmospheric temperatures.

When the radio beacon-equipped OS is within range of the ERV&#x27;s optical sensors, the ERV will optically track and approach the OS, maneuvering itself to place the OS within its capture device. One of the key technologies required to accomplish this mission involves a low-mass, highly reliable mechanism that detects contact with and captures the OS, and, once the OS is captured, moves the OS to a containment area for the return trip to Earth. There is an on-going body of research into such capture mechanism designs and the various advantages and challenges of these technologies.

NASA is interested in improving thermal insulation for future Mars missions, including Evolvable Mars Campaign, Mars Landers and Mars ISRU cryogenic fuel storage on Mars surface. Cryogenic propellants have the highest energy density of any chemical rocket fuel, propel most NASA and commercial launch vehicles, and would be used for Mars Lander EDL/ascent. Cryogenic propellants require good thermal insulation. Improvements in propellant storage and transfer are a critical need for future NASA missions, with zero boil off of cryogenic propellant an important goal. High performance insulation is needed for future Mars missions to store liquid methane obtained from the Mars regolith and stored on Mars surface. Quest Thermal Group proposes to design and develop an innovative, lightweight thermal insulation system, designed to perform and insulate cryogenic propellants in multiple environments, such as in-air on Earth prelaunch and launch ascent, in-space cruise phase, on-Mars surface and during Mars Lander ascent. Multi-Environment MLI (MEMLI) is a novel multi-functional thermal insulation system that uses a ventable/sealable, lightweight supported vacuum shell, integrated and supported by Load Bearing MLI layers specifically tuned for Mars atmosphere.

      "description": "Several advanced thermal protection system (TPS) materials currently under development, such as conformal and woven systems, leverage the porous ablator technology developed for phenolic impregnated carbon ablator (PICA), a binary-constituent composite resin infiltrated carbon fiber substrate system. Current ablation models assume thermodynamic equilibrium chemistry to estimate the recession rate and temperature response, and these models are known to be deficient because they over predicted the recession rate, for example, during the Mars Science Laboratory entry into the Martian atmosphere. Clearly, non-equilibrium chemistry is important in such environments; therefore, non-equilibrium models must be built on a fundamental understanding of the relevant non-equilibrium chemical kinetics and dynamics, which may be obtained from in situ measurements of chemical processes during pyrolysis of PICA-class materials under controlled, non-equilibrium conditions. Validating the models with such high quality laboratory data will enable optimized risk and margin recommendations for a whole generation of future NASA and commercial space missions. The objective of this effort is to transform our understanding of the decomposition chemistry of carbon/phenolic composite ablator materials using advanced techniques that are well established in the field of reaction dynamics but have not previously been applied to understand the decomposition mechanisms of these materials in an atmospheric entry environment. To achieve the objective, we will measure time-dependent yields of volatile products during the pyrolysis of a phenolic resin and a carbon/phenolic composite, and we will study the kinetics and dynamics of the heterogeneous reactions of ablation products and representative boundary gases (from Earth and Mars environments) with char and with preform carbon surfaces. We will also investigate the erosion kinetics of pure phenolic resin and a carbon/phenolic composite at high temperatures in a simulated boundary-gas environment. The focus materials will be PICA, obtained from Fiber Materials, Inc., and the separate preform carbon and phenolic resin components of this composite. The experiments will utilize a molecular beam apparatus with a highly sensitive, triply differentially-pumped mass spectrometer. The mass spectrometer will be used to detect pyrolysis products of hot materials and reactive products when controlled material surfaces are bombarded with beams of specific reagent gases. Pyrolysis products will be detected from surfaces with temperatures from ambient to about 1500 K, while beam-surface reactive products may be detected from surfaces with temperatures up to about 2200 K. For kinetic studies of erosion, surfaces at various temperatures will be bombarded by beams containing pure O2, N2, or CO2 and mixtures containing O, O2, CO, CO2, N, and/or N2 in mole ratios to be specified. Exposed surfaces will be probed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The PI intends to work closely with NASA researchers to ensure that the experiments conducted will generate data that will validate ablation models under development.",

      "description": "NASA Technology Area 7 identifies one of the challenges of exploration and human activities in space is the scarcity of readily usable resources. This scarcity is mainly due to limited payloads carried from Earth and lack of developed technology capable of optimally processing extraterrestrial resources in-situ. Therefore, payloads, activities, and the duration of a mission in space are very restrained. Current in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) methods are making headway to tackle this challenge. Conventional reactors are large in size, heavy, and have low performance in heat and mass transfer performance, which result in high costs while operating at very low rate and efficiency. Microchannel reactors overcome these limitations with their exceptional thermal regulation and chemical processes control, as well as scalability for higher production. They have high heat and mass transfer rates, which enables higher efficiencies, while their small scale design reduces size and weight, it also improves conversion, yield, selectivity, and catalyst life. Optimizing their design will allow for sustainable human activities in space. Besides significant improvements over conventional reactors, ceramic microchannel reactors are much more advantageous than metallic counterparts because of their lower cost and weight, higher resistance to corrosion, compatibility with ceramic-supported catalysts, and very high temperature operation. Ceramic microchannel reactors offer very high potential as an innovative, enabling technology for NASA TABS 7.1 &quot;In-Situ Resource Utilization&quot; goals as well as general space exploration missions. This project proposes to investigate the ceramic microchannel reactor technology as a potential innovation in performing ISRU. To demonstrate the space ISRU capabilities of a ceramic microchannel reactor, the project aims to build upon the goal of human exploration on Mars. Since Martian atmosphere is composed of mainly carbon dioxide, and water is present as a hydrogen source, the Sabatier chemical reaction will be used to convert carbon dioxide and hydrogen to water and methane, which is to be used as propellant. The specific objective is to achieve a production rate of more than 32 grams per hour of methane and at least 72 grams per hour of water, as goals defined by NASA&#x27;s Mars Atmosphere and Regolith COllector/PrOcessor for Lander Operations project. The project will occur within the scope of a two-year MS thesis program, consisting of two phases. In phase one, all testing with Sabatier process in the current ceramic microchannel reactor will be completed. Experimentation will be performed on the existing full test stand with a ceramic microchannel reactor at the Colorado Fuel Cell Center, Colorado School of Mines. ANSYS Fluent models will be made to develop understanding of internal Sabatier kinetics within the reactor and to interpret reactor physical processes. Phase two will focus on the optimization of the reactor to enhance performance and reconfigure infrastructure for Mars ISRU application. Through which, ruthenium catalyst will be applied into experimentation and new system-designs will be developed to integrate hydrogen-separation membranes. Throughout the project, results will be presented at conference proceedings, and finally ending with dissemination of findings in peer-reviewed literature.",

Thus, current mission architectures must compensate for replacement. In space, spent electronics are discarded; on earth, there is some recycling but current processes are toxic and environmentally hazardous. Imagine instead an end-to-end recycling of spent electronics at low mass, low cost, room temperature, and in a non-toxic manner. Here, we propose a solution that will not only enhance mission success by decreasing upmass and providing a fresh supply of electronics, but in addition has immediate applications to a serious environmental issue on the Earth. Spent electronics will be used as feedstock to make fresh electronic components, a process we will accomplish with so-called &#x27;urban biomining&#x27; using synthetically enhanced microbes to bind metals with elemental specificity. To create new electronics, the microbes will be used as &#x27;bioink&#x27; to print a new IC chip, using plasma jet electronics printing. The plasma jet electronics printing technology will have the potential to use martian atmospheric gas to print and to tailor the electronic and chemical properties of the materials. Our preliminary results have suggested that this process also serves as a purification step to enhance the proportion of metals in the &#x27;bioink&#x27;. The presence of electric field and plasma can ensure printing in microgravity environment while also providing material morphology and electronic structure tunabiity and thus optimization.

To assess the ability of this concept to influence mission architecture, we will do an analysis of the infrastructure required to execute this concept on Mars, and additional opportunities it could offer mission design from the biological and printing technologies. In addition, we will do an analysis of the impact of this technology for terrestrial applications addressing in particular environmental concerns and availability of metals.",

One area where radiation shielding may be incorporated is in thermal insulation materials. The design of habitation structures and exploration vehicles will require extensive thermal protection.

      "description": "An entering spacecraft must decelerate from speeds of kilometers per second to zero in the span of only minutes  a sequence aptly dubbed Seven Minutes of Terror on Mars Science Laboratory. Most of this kinetic energy is converted to thermal energy as the vehicle decelerates in the atmosphere. A thermal protection system (TPS), or heatshield, forms the outer surface of the spacecraft and provides critical protection from this intense heating. Whether returning from Earth orbit or entering other planetary atmospheres, a TPS is crucial for mission success. The proposed research seeks to advance the readiness of new conformal ablative TPS materials and their corresponding fabrication process to (1) address NASA goals for lower cost, lower mass, more sustainable TPS systems and (2) make TPS accessible to small companies, universities and research labs, which historically have not possessed the resources for such technology. Ablative TPS, a particular class of TPS material, have been used almost exclusively for planetary probes to date. However, these materials require often complex, labor-intensive fabrication processes. Conformal ablators have the potential to simplify manufacturing and assembly by utilizing flexible, high strain-to-failure component materials. Therefore, it can be formed in large segments and directly bonded to an aeroshell without gap fillers. As a result, reliability is increased and cost and complexity decreased compared to traditional materials. In turn, these improvements can drive TPS cost and mass fraction down. Conformal TPS is a composite material consisting of a carbonized rayon felt substrate infiltrated with an organic resin. By leveraging related techniques in composites fabrication, this research will streamline the manufacturing process, ultimately, leading to improved material consistency, process standardization and the production of a complete small-probe aeroshell. Investigations will include vacuum bagging (to improve resin infiltration), automation (to limit manual labor) and novel folding methods (to form larger, curved segments). Alternative, more environmentally-friendly resin materials will also be evaluated. These improvements can advance conformal ablators from the current state-of-the-art to a high technology readiness level. The proposed work addresses future mission needs for Earth, Mars and other planetary entries while realizing significant system-level benefits such as increased production speed, increased material consistency, reduced cost and reduced environmental impact in TPS manufacturing. Such a low-cost, easily manufactured and reliable TPS can benefit both small- and large-scale NASA missions and expand access to recoverable missions to the broader space community.",

Laser based optical communication links for space provides more than an order of magnitude higher data rates than corresponding RF links..

In addition, power-scaling to 10W, athermal operation over a wide temperature range (with passive conductive cooling only), and improved power efficiency, are simultaneously addressed.

These pumps would also be useful on other missions to planets and satellites with atmosphere, such as Titan, as well as terrestrial applications on Earth. In order to allow these high vacuum pumps to operate in high-pressure environments such as exist on Titan and Earth, the vacuum pump needs to be supplemented with a rough pump that can take its exhaust and compress it to 11.5 atm. This project aims to design, fabricate, test, and deliver such a compact vacuum pump system that can generate a high vacuum, on the order of 1e-8 torr, and exhaust directly to an Earth or Titan atmosphere. The pump will be assembled in a very compact, robust, and low-power package. Our Phase I project clearly demonstrated the feasibility of our innovative design by demonstrating the performance of a rough pump and designing a compact vacuum system for use on Earth or other planetary bodies with atmospheric pressure greater than 1 atm.

      "description": "The aerosols that reside in the atmospheres of the Giant Planets, Venus and Titan are the visible faces of these planets, and yet we have quite limited knowledge of them. The impact of this lack of knowledge is significant on our understanding of the composition, structure and dynamics of these planetary atmospheres. For the Giant Planets, remote sensing cannot adequately identify even the level at which the clouds that form the familiar shapes reside. Consequently, we only roughly know the level of deposition of solar energy or the altitude at which the tracked winds reside. For Venus, an unknown blue absorber contributes a significant amount to the energy balance of the middle atmosphere. Only by studying the aerosols of these atmospheres in situ will we be able to characterize their properties with sufficient precision to move forward in answering many of these questions. Our proposed Planetary Polarization Nephelometer will supply more complete information on the size, shape, number density and chemical composition than any other cloud particle instrument proposed for planetary (or terrestrial) use. Our proposed instrument has already benefitted from three years of PIDDP funding, where the instrument went from just an idea to a proven capability using bench-top hardware. We now sit at TRL3 and have a well-developed plan to reach TRL 5 at the end of 3 years of work. We will first build component-level maturation demonstrations of the key technologies (i.e., laser drive modulators, receive-side optics and fibers, detector linear array control and readout) and then work to integrate these all into a prototype that will be tested under appropriate environmental conditions. We will not seek to make this prototype flight qualifiable itself, but we will fabricate it using components that have a clear path to flight. The proposed instrument development is relevant to the PICASSO Program because it seeks to mature low TRL instrument technology (TRL 3 in our case) that would be applicable to several potential near-future missions fro the Planetary Decadal Survey: Saturn Probe, Venus In Situ Explorer, Venus Climate Mission, Uranus Orbiter and Probe. It would also have good impact as part of a Titan in situ mission or the Comet Surface Sample Return, as well as Mars or Moon in situ missions. Our technical maturity and well-developed plan for reaching TRL5 (and minimizing the stretch to TRL6) would position this instrument well for upcoming future missions.",

Both reusable and ablative TPS have been developed to protect spacecraft. Typically, reusable TPS have been used for the Shuttle where the reentry conditions are relatively mild while ablative TPS materials have been used on planetary entry probes where high heating rates are generated. Additional advances in TPS design are needed to deliver large payloads to the moon and Mars, and to explore the outer planets. Flexible or deployable aeroshells offer an approach for achieving larger aeroshell surface areas for entry vehicles than otherwise attainable without deployment. Larger surface area aeroshells offer the ability to decelerate high-mass entry vehicles at relatively low ballistic coefficients. However, for an aeroshell to perform even at the low ballistic coefficients attainable with deployable aeroshells, a flexible thermal protection system (TPS) is required that is capable of surviving reasonably high heat flux and durable enough to survive the rigors of construction, handling, and deployment.

Based on the success of the current Mars Science Laboratory rover instrument ChemCam, the first ever laser-based spectrographic system to be selected as an instrument on a NASA spacecraft, the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP) has developed and tested a prototype instrument. This new instrument is capable of at least 10,000 times greater sensitivity than the ChemCam instrument, allowing faster measurements up to 8 m away with a focused laser beam. This integrated, compact remote instrument is called the Compact integrated instrument for Remote Spectroscopy Analysis (CiiRSA).

Such systems have been the subject of research since the dawn of human spaceflight.1 Once astronauts reach the surface, food and water in addition to a sustainable, breathable atmosphere are also a necessity. In situ resource utilization on the surface can greatly reduce launch mass requirements and greatly extend surface operation duration, allowing more detailed and longer duration expeditions. This effort aims to address both in-transit and surface operations life support needs for a notional human expedition to the Moon, Mars2 and beyond. At the center of this proposed life support system is nonthermal plasma as the active element. Recent advances in plasma science has enabled the application of cold plasmas for water purification, air quality control (e.g. indoor pollution), and enhanced agriculture. Electrical energy can be used to convert any atmosphere into a plasma-activated, reactive gas for the purpose of carbon dioxide breakdown and ultimate extraction of oxygen, the generation of reactive species to treat water to all for potable water recycling, the extraction of water from permafrost3, plasma treatment of seeds for enhanced yield, and the plasma treatment for water to infuse important nitrates into solution for enhanced growth (plasma agriculture).4 In the laboratory, these functions have been demonstrated. We stand at the precipice of the advancement of plasma technology that has the transformative potential to greatly both enable and simply life support systems for human spaceflight. Investment in this proposed effort is important in that it sounds the groundwork for a viable advanced life support system that is generic in application. The transportable technology can support deep space transit as well as surface operations. It only requires electrical power - power of which is used to drive electrons to support nonthermal, high selectivity chemical reactions without the need for consumables - rather it utilizes available raw materials as its feed stock firmly grounding the approach as an in situ utilization method. The goal is to show that plasma-based subsystems can form the basis for a life support system.",

While other Mars flight vehicle concepts have proposed gliding flight with crash landings or low efficiency hovering flight with very little ground coverage, the proposed concept will combine hovering and fast forward flight capability into a single efficient aircraft that can be recharged and reused many times. The extremely low surface pressure on Mars requires new low-Reynolds number, low-density aerodynamics combined with a light-weight structure with extremely low disc loading and low wing loading. The main objectives in FY2017 are: 1) Perform a high altitude balloon drop model test from approximately 100,000 feet to gather key aerodynamic and controls data such as lift coefficient, drag coefficient, and stability characteristics in a relevant environment. An NASA Flight Opportunity Program award has been granted to the project to perform the high altitude balloon drop in the Spring of 2017.2) Begin the investigation of new fabrication techniques that will enable very low weight airframe and propeller designs. These designs may include laser cut carbon fiber frames and durable surface coverings that can withstand low temperatures and dust abrasion over long periods of time. Full-size airframes will be constructed and flown in a 60 foot diameter low pressure chamber at NASA Langley Research Center. 3) Continue flight research on vision-based autonomous navigation (visual odometry / IMU fusion) with a focus on hovering navigation in a 3-D environment simulating extreme terrain such as lava tubes and canyons. The exploration of Mars surface has focused on orbiters that can gather global scale data, and slow-moving rovers that get only local data.

We noticed that simply wetting the material, mixing it thoroughly, and drying it (in vacuum or air) at ambient temperature causes it to bond into solid, very hard rock, and we could control the hardness by the amount of water mixed into it before drying. On Earth when making bricks from clay we need to fire them in a kiln at temperatures as high as 1300⁰C to make them hard. Apparently simple air or vacuum drying of these minerals can substitute for the kiln effectively, making it easily hard enough for construction in the space environment. Carbonaceous asteroids are not the only place in space where clayey regolith can be used for construction. Recently, scientists have shown that Mars has abundant clay deposits all over the globe. The minerals on Phobos appear similar to those in a certain type of carbonaceous asteroid including phyllosilicates (the type of minerals that include clays), so apparently Phobos may have abundant clay minerals, too. This suggests construction by low-temperature vacuum drying is possible on those bodies. It is not possible on the Moon, however, as there are no phyllosilicates on the Moon.",

Human scale mass missions, the ultimate goal in NASA&#x27;s human space exploration plans, will require 20-60 tons of landed payload mass.&quot; To be capable of launching higher mass vehicles for robotic sample return and human exploration to Mars, improved accuracy in the prediction of aerodynamics and thermal loads must be made. This project will place an emphasis on Section 9.1 Aeroassist and Atmospheric Entry, specifically lower level section 1.1.6 Entry Modeling and Simulation of the TA09 roadmap. A need to produce experimental validation through ground testing is presented in the project narrative. Problematically, current state-of-the-art simulations are limited by a lack of experimental data where the free-stream thermochemical state is not well characterized. If the flow is accelerated from stagnation to hypersonic conditions through a nozzle, freezing can occur and the free stream will be partially dissociated. (Nompelis et al. 2003, 2007). The entire nozzle flow would have to be simulated and the freestream predictions of today are deemed to be inadequate. (Nompelis et al. 2010, Doraiwamy et al. 2010). To overcome this challenge, the proposed experiments will be carried out in an expansion tube facility where free stream dissociation is minimized allowing for an improved database of surface and flow field measurements at hypervelocity conditions. The Hypervelocity Expansion Tube (HET) facility at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign was specifically built to eliminate the experimental challenge of freestream dissociation by accelerating the test gas through an unsteady expansion wave, rather than a nozzle. The HET has the capability of reaching a broad range of test gas conditions simply by changing the initial pressure and gas composition in the facility sections. This work has direct correlations between Space Technology Roadmaps for Entry, descent, and landing systems, specifically lower level section 1.1.6 of TABS element 9.1, because it will improve the entry modeling and simulation models for a hypersonic, chemically reacting environment.

However, high dynamic pressure aerocapture is high risk and requires large, complex, and heavy deflector shells. Magnetoshell Aerocapture (MAC) is a revolutionary technology that has been developed by NASA and MSNW that can enable low-cost, low-risk aerocapture for a range of Earth and deep space missions. The Magnetoshell deploys a simple dipole magnetic field containing a magnetized plasma. Interaction of neutral particles in the atmosphere with this magnetized plasma produces the desired drag for braking, acting in effect like a plasma parachute. With the aeroshell now being composed of a massless magnetic field, the scale of the shell can be as large as 100 meters with only a gram of plasma and a simple copper magnet. Drag can be dynamically controlled in response to atmospheric conditions, enabling very aggressive aerocapture maneuvers. By providing pulsed power, the thermal and power processing requirements can be kept within the scope of conventional technologies. In a Phase I NIAC program a 1.6 meter diameter Magnetoshell was demonstrated and increased the drag force of a supersonic flowing neutral jet by 1000X. A wide range of mission studies showed that MAC can enable a Neptune orbiter mission, reduce the cost of a manned Martian mission by $2B, and provide the low-cost drag system for Earth return missions. In the following proposal a three year ISS-launched CubeSat demonstration mission paves the way for full scale operation missions. In Phase I a complete system design will be completed and several of the primary technology risks will be mitigated.

Consequently, significant propellant mass will be required. While it is technically feasible to generate O2 and CO propellants by electrolysis of CO2 from the Martian atmosphere, it will only work on bodies where there is significant CO2 in the atmosphere, and the mass of the required infrastructure (electrolyzer, batteries, solar panels) is significant. A recent study has shown that bringing the propellant from Earth is a mass-competitive option. In particular, a hybrid rocket with multi-start capability trades more favorably than either a CO2 electrolysis system or a bipropellant system where the propellants are generated on Earth. Using a high-performance hybrid propellant combination and being able to restart the hybrid rocket are the keys. In previous and ongoing work, Ultramet has demonstrated that electrically heated open-cell silicon carbide foam can be used as an igniter for both monopropellant and bipropellant rocket engines. Due to its low mass and favorable electrical characteristics, the foam can be heated to 1300?C in just two seconds, which enables it to quickly ignite any propellant flowing through it. In this project, the technology will be applied to hybrid rocket engines to give them multi-start capability. A portion of the liquid oxidizer stream (typically oxygen or nitrogen tetroxide) will pass through the foam and be heated such that the high temperature gas leaving the foam will be sufficiently hot to cause spontaneous ignition on contact with the fuel (typically paraffin). Once the engine is ignited, power to the foam heater can be turned off. Ultramet will design, test, and characterize electrically powered foam heaters and perform ignition testing with paraffin fuel grains.",

      "description": "NASA&#x19;s Phoenix lander measured high perchlorate concentrations (0.5% to 1.0%) in the regolith of Mars. In contrast, perchlorate is widely distributed on Earth, but typically occurs at only very low abundances (&lt;&lt;0.01%). However, it is hazardous at low concentrations to humans, and exposure limits of 24 ppb have been established for drinking water. Perchlorate is also mutagenic for some bacteria, and can have adverse impacts on a variety of animals. Thus, it clearly poses challenges for both human habitation and exploration of Mars, as well as for terraforming based on the use microbes that might prove perchlorate-sensitive. Thus, it is essential to identify bacteria that can detoxify perchlorate, and that also can provide additional ecosystem services through biogeochemical functions that contribute to terraforming. TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION Bacteria capable of reducing perchlorate to non-toxic chloride have been documented previously, but most of these isolates have limited application for Mars, since they require reductants, such as hydrogen, acetate or other complex organics, that do not occur at significant levels in regolith. Furthermore, high salt concentrations, which are common at Mars&#x19; surface, inhibit most known perchlorate reducers. Recently, however, several common extremely halophilic archaea have been identified that reduce perchlorate to chloride; in addition, several closely related extremely halophilic archaea have also been shown to use carbon monoxide (CO) as a metabolic substrate. Since CO occurs at very high concentrations (&gt; 800 ppm) in Mars&#x19; atmosphere, we propose to investigate the feasibility of using a novel process, i.e., halophilic CO-dependent perchlorate reduction, for perchlorate bioremediation. We expect to establish this process quickly, since there is no biological reason that the two should be mutually exclusive, and since the two functions now appear to be relatively common among the halophilic euryarchaeota. INNOVATION STATEMENT The feasibility of detoxifying perchlorate-contaminated groundwater has been demonstrated previously in bioreactors using acetate or hydrogen as a source of reductant. However, the suitability of CO as a reductant has not yet been pursued. The work proposed here will thus represent the first attempt to employ a novel microbial process to detoxify perchlorate using an atmospheric resource abundant on Mars. We also anticipate that the outcome of our work will have broad applications for terraforming and Mars habitation. TECHNICAL READINESS LEVEL (TRL) TRL (10/1/14): TRL 2 TRL (9/30/15): TRL 4 PARTNERSHIPS Brad Bebout will conduct analyses of CO uptake and perchlorate reduction in previously collected saline soils/sediments and microbial mats already in his possession from a number of field collections, as well as field sites to be visited as part of the work proposed here (Task 1). This will serve to identify target sites for enrichment/isolation efforts and to characterize possible relevant ecological/environmental controls. He will construct engineered communities of organisms capable of perchlorate reduction and organisms capable of generating reductant necessary for this process (cyanobacteria) (Task 4). Gary King will screen existing and new isolates for CO oxidation/perchlorate reduction using molecular and physiological assays (Task 2) and assess environmental tolerances of the isolates for CO-based perchlorate reduction (Task 3). He will obtain material for new isolations at a promising new field locality at Bonneville Salt Flat, near Salt Lake City, Utah. DELIVERABLES Task 1. Characterize CO uptake and perchlorate reduction in natural communities of extreme halophiles. Expected completion: 10/1/14 - 3/30/15. Details: We will assess both CO uptake and perchlorate reduction by natural communities of extreme halophiles using two model systems: salt crusts and salt-saturated sediments of the Bonneville Salt Flat (UT) and arid, saline soils from Wendover, UT south of Bonneville. We will amend crusts, sediments and soils with perchlorate under a variety of conditions and manipulate CO availability to determine the capacity of these systems to reduce perchlorate, and to couple reduction to CO oxidation. Results will help identify systems to target for enrichment and isolation, and will provide novel insights about controls of perchlorate reduction relevant for understanding multi-species communities that might ultimately be assembled for use on Mars. Task 2. Identify novel extremely halophilic CO-oxidizing perchlorate reducers. Expected completion: 10/1/14 - 9/30/15. Details: We will screen new and existing collections of extreme halophiles for CO oxidation, and identify perchlorate-reducing isolates. New collections will be derived from ongoing efforts to characterize halophiles in saline arid soils and salt flats; existing isolates will be selected from a wide range of sources, including solar salterns, and saline temperate, tropical and Antarctic lakes. Task 3. Assess environmental tolerances for CO-based perchlorate reduction. Expected Completion: 1/1/14 - 9/30/15. Details: Isolates obtained from Task 2 will be used to determine the range of environmental conditions under which extreme halophiles reduce perchlorate with CO as a substrate. Variables will include salt, perchlorate, nitrate, oxygen and CO concentrations, temperature, and pressure among others. Task 4. Using a Synthetic Ecology Approach to Build Communities Capable of Using the Sun&#x19;s Energy to Reduce Perchlorate. Expected Completion: 4/1/14 - 9/30/15. Details: We will construct model microbial communities of extremely halophilic CO-oxidizers, and assess their capacity to persist using CO. Isolates from Task 2 will be grown individually on basalt cinders, sand or Mars regolith analog following protocols we have used successfully with Alkalilimnicola ehrlichii MLHE1. We will also use additional isolates to develop more functionally complex communities. For example, the EPS-producing moderately halophilic Halomonas maura (Argando&#xf1;a et al., 2006) will be used to add a capacity for nitrogen fixation, and MLHE1 will be used to introduce complexity to nitrogen transformations (nitrate respiration versus denitrification) and an alternate pathway for CO2 fixation (CBB; Hoeft et al., 2007). Total densities of mixed populations will be equivalent to those of individual populations. We will then subject both individual and mixed populations to water potential and temperature stresses with varied oxidant regimes to assess impacts on CO uptake and population and community persistence. To measure persistence, we will use growth-based recovery assays combined with 16S rRNA abundance measurements for mixed populations. The use of cyanobacteria to provide acetate (via fermentation) as a reductant for PRB will be investigated. Cyanobacteria isolated from microbial mats are known to support the growth of various heterotrophic bacteria via fermentation of their exuded photosynthate. We will combine these cyanobacteria with PRB.",

      "description": "This proposed effort builds on a 2017 CIF/IRAD titled Safe Crew Abort and Recovery for Ascent and Descent at the Moon and Mars that presented a reusable transportation system concept known as Hercules that validated the conceptual capability to perform safe crew aborts at both the moon (during descent and ascent phases) and at Mars (during ascent, entry, descent and landing phases). The Hercules vehicle concept, developed initially to support Mars landings, now supports a range of mission segments including Earth launch, cis-lunar operations, lunar landings, interplanetary transfer between Earth and Mars, and at Mars as a single-stage reusable lander. The commonality of the vehicle structure and configuration across a range of missions with increasing capability beyond Earth orbit provides a low cost development strategy that can initiate in the near term to support cis-lunar and lunar landing operations while buying down the risk of future missions supporting Mars. In addition, key technologies and capabilities needed for many beyond low-Earth orbit missions are proven in the near term using the Hercules platform by flying low cost, low risk missions at Earth and in cis-Lunar space. These technologies include several &quot;system-level&quot; capabilities that are at or near Technology Readiness Level (TRL) 5 or 6 but lack the system development and demonstration in relevant environments to cross the proverbial technology &quot;valley of death&quot;. This includes technologies and capabilities such as: 1) demonstration of large-scale EDL, 2) demonstration of aerocapture; 3) demonstration of cryogenic propellant management and long-duration propellant storage; and 4) demonstration of cryogenic propellant resupply.&#x5c;nIdea Description&#x5c;n Today, optimization of vehicle performance for each mission segment drives NASA to procure unique systems for each segment. While optimal from a mass performance and near-term affordability standpoint, these systems often neglect or give lip-service to the risk mitigation, crew safety, and long-term affordability attributes of the architecture when viewed not as a single mission but as a long-term campaign. Hercules&#x27; reusable, commonality-driven design in support of a long-term settlement campaign strategy allows design and operations risks to be mitigated/retired in the near-term while long-term affordability and risk benefits are realized through demonstrated reusability and crew safety. This strategy is extremely important to NASA and commercial enterprises interested in economic development of the moon and space. If successful, the common Hercules vehicle platform will enable both NASA (science, exploration and settlement) and industry (economic development) goals over several decades.",

While this technique is practical and effective, some state-of-the-art electronics and other thermally sensitive components make this technique unusable for certain materials. One potential alternative technique for surface sterilization of a fully assembled spacecraft or components is the use of atmospheric pressure plasma jet (APPJ), which has been an area of investigation within the biomedical community.

The ADEPT design approach takes advantage of the high thermal conductivity and emissivity of the carbon cloth, and the open back allows for much of the energy to be radiated off the back surface. The design will need to allow for determination of the temperatures of both the front and the back surfaces of the cloth, so accommodation of back surface pyrometry will be required.

The Micro Return Capsule (MIRCA) is CAPE&#x19;s first Planetary Entry Probe (PEP) flight prototype. Within this context, this project continues to develop the CAPE concept, and as part of the technology pathway, will carry out a balloon drop test flight experiment of MIRCA to verify deployment, flight software, communications, and aerodynamic parameters in a relevant environment. So far, no microprobe (less than 10 kg) has entered another planetary atmosphere and successfully relayed data back to Earth. Although the Deep Space 2 Mars microprobes did reach their destination (total mass about 6.5 kg each), unfortunately they were lost due to a combination of delivery system failures and other unknown factors. This project expands on the concept of a planetary entry probe based on the widely popular Cubesat-class spacecraft specification (Cubesat Application for Planetary Entry Missions, or CAPE probes). Within a science operational context, CAPE probes may be sent from Earth to study a celestial body&#x19;s atmosphere, or to land/impact on some high-value target on its surface. Either one or multiple probes may be targeted to distributed locations throughout the geographic landscape and could be released systematically and methodically from an orbiting spacecraft. CAPE microprobes would each have its own propulsion, and hence would be capable of targeting regions identified by the mother ship as high-interest. This enables a completely new capability for science not possible with traditional &#x1c;drop-and-flyby&#x1d; schemes. To supplement its flexibility, each probe would incorporate a communications architecture that provides a high-level of assurance its precious data is acquired and transmitted back to Earth for analysis. CAPE consists of two main functional components: the &#x1c;service module&#x1d; (SM), and the &#x1c;planetary entry probe&#x1d; (PEP). The SM contains the subsystems necessary to support vehicle targeting (propulsion, ACS, computer, power) and the communications capability to relay data from the PEP probe to an orbiting &#x1c;mother-ship&#x1d;.

Improved understanding will (1) facilitate the design of new, novel ablative materials and (2) improve material response models used for TSP design. We will demonstrate and validate phenolic pyrolysis simulation methods using reactive potentials (REAX), Density Functional Tight Binding (DFTB) and Density Functional Theory (DFT). Ablative materials are required for the most demanding atmospheric reentry missions. These materials are often carbon fibers embedded in a phenolic polymer matrix. At high temperature, phenolic undergoes pyrolysis where the polymer is transformed into a pure carbon solid called char. Pyrolysis is an endothermic, chemically reactive process, and is the only in-depth energy absorbing mechanism used in ablative systems. High char yield is desirable to minimize mass loss into gaseous products. Importantly, polymer char yields can vary substantially. Further, thermal and mechanical properties of the pyrolyzed material can be very different from the original material. Optimizing properties of the char surface layer is crucial, since it is the part of the TSP in direct contact with the hot reentry plasma. A robust pyrolysis simulation methodology (which does not currently exist) will aid in understanding the structure and properties of phenolic and in developing new polymers with higher char yield and char with improved properties. In addition, more accurate material response models, used to design TSP, will result, thereby leading to reduced safety margins, and thus reduced mass/cost of the TPS. We will perform atomistic pyrolysis simulations using REAX, DFTB and DFT to demonstrate the different methods, and in particular to validate REAX for pyrolysis of realistic polymers (phenolic and otherwise). In addition, we will obtain important insights into chemical kinetics of early stage pyrolysis.

Future EDL missions of interest at Earth, Mars, Venus, Titan, and the outer planets will require a significant increase in the performance capabilities of EDL systems. This increase in capability can only be achieved through the development of new EDL technologies, such as deployable hypersonic decelerators. As stated in NASA&#x27;s draft Space Technology Roadmap, deployable hypersonic decelerators (DHDs) have the potential to revolutionize EDL systems, enabling NASA&#x27;s next generation of exploration missions. However, significant feasibility questions remain about guidance and control systems for DHD vehicles. While NASA has embarked on a substantial inflatable DHD technology maturation effort over the past several years, very little development work has been completed for rigid deployable systems, and only limited work has been completed to date in the area of guidance and control for DHDs. Open guidance and control questions center around whether DHD vehicles possess adequate trajectory control authority to achieve mission objectives, such as precision landing, when high-altitude atmospheric variability, realistic flight control actuation systems, and FSI effects are included. At the EDL system level, realistic DHD vehicle performance capability has not yet been clearly determined. The proposed research revolves around two coupled areas of design and analysis: system-level mission design and performance analysis and subsystem-level guidance and control design and analysis. Numeric simulation, uncertainty analysis, and trade studies will be conducted in both areas in parallel to answer fundamental questions about the feasibility of DHD entry systems. Specifically, this research effort is expected to characterize the impact of DHDs on guidance and control subsystem design, develop preliminary DHD guidance and control system options and algorithms, determine realistic expectations for DHD vehicle performance, and identify additional applications for DHD vehicles beyond high-mass Mars missions.",

Such a goal requires an innovative solution to the vehicle&#x27;s entry, decent and landing system (EDL). In order to address this goal,NASA has recently invested in the development of low ballistic coefficient aeroshell technology concepts which typically consist of a flexible 3D woven carbon cloth that can be stowed during flight and deployed to serve as a semi-rigid aeroshell on atmospheric entry. The ability of individual groups of fibers within yarn bundles to undulate in multiple orientations relative to the major axis of the yarn bundle results in full anisotropy for the 3D woven preforms.

      "description": "Although the theoretical case for space biological engineering is convincing, since recent studies on the use of biology in space showed substantial payload minimization over abiotic approaches even before any engineering, the functioning of these biological technologies has yet to be proven in a space-like environment. We will study such functioning for a synthetic biology architecture that can detoxify the perchlorate in Mars soil and also enrich it with ammonia. Our work will inform a prime deliverable of a comparative assessment with alternate chemical approaches postulated or scoped by NASA, and will clarify the feasibility of utilizing our proposed biotechnology to support manned Mars missions. The two system processes of perchlorate reduction and nitrogen fixation individually exist in biology and, when combined, will potentiate soil-based agriculture (by plants or microbes) on Mars. Our concept architecture is a single model organism that will eventually have both systems that are now separate in different strains of the same species. The advantages of our proposed architecture over current approaches, such as washing out perchlorate to cleanse soil or using hydroponics to grow plants, include a low initialization mass of microbial cells, on- demand cell growth with in situ resources, and the elimination of toxic wastewater. To accomplish our proposed concept architecture, we will investigate two strains of a diverse clade of organisms, Pseudomonas, which includes relevant extremophiles. Pseudomonas stutzeri PDA is a perchlorate reducer that we have previously studied using a method that examines the fitness profiles of organism mutants in several environment conditions to obtain genetic determinants of fitness. Pseudomonas stutzeri is also capable of nitrogen fixation (e.g. strain A1501). Pseudomonas has two advantages that make experiments with it more practical than with other space synthetic biology possibilities like photosynthetic, extremophile cyanobacteria: the use of the same host cloning vectors as the model laboratory organism Escherichia coli, and a doubling time of an hour, which is much faster than seven hours for a model non-extremophile cyanobacterium and four days for a model extremophile cyanobacterium. We will test an environmentally-relevant Pseudomonas host that, in follow-on work, we expect to refactor for efficient expression, operation, and interfacing to different hosts including Pseudomonad extremophiles, cyanobacteria, and other mission possibilities. Here, we will map perchlorate reduction and nitrogen fixation performance to host physiology and environment variables. Since we have already developed a microbial growth chamber that can apply environment parameters over Mars-relevant ranges, e.g., pressure from 10 kPa, temperature from -60 degrees C to 40 degrees C, light intensities up to 25 klx, UV radiation, and a 95%-3% carbon dioxide-nitrogen atmosphere, we will study how strains PDA and A1501 perform in increasingly Mars-like conditions, and what genetic mechanisms mediate survival, growth and activities in these conditions. By controllably exploring functionality, we will map the most extreme conditions in which our mesophile can survive, grow and perform. We will then identify limitations on these activities, and derive targets for future individual and joint optimization of system operation in parameter ranges that are more like Mars. Our work will enable a techno-economic analysis of performance versus output-generation time, input/nutrient mass needs, necessity of alternate chemical approaches, etc. Our concept will achieve the &#x1c;promising potential&#x1d; of biological technologies, identified in the 2015 NASA Technology Roadmap TA 7 as &#x1c;deserve[ing] sine attention.&#x1d; Broader impacts include Earth-based bioremediation (e.g., land cleanup near oil wells and toxic spills) and non-arable land enrichment to improve food production to address famines, drought, larger populations, etc.",

Results obtained during the Phase I effort point to three promising diagnostic techniques: Rayleigh Scattering Polarimetry (RSP) for dissociation fraction, Thermal Acoustic Wave (TAW) thermometry for gas temperature, and Radar Resonance Enhanced Multi-photon Ionization (Radar REMPI) for gas temperature and velocity. The RSP technique is based on the differences in the polarization of Rayleigh-scattered light between atoms and molecules. The TAW technique is based on the determination of wave speed from the propagation of an acoustic wave generated by a laser spark from the focused beam of a pulsed laser. In the case of Radar REMPI, temperature and velocity are obtained through the spectral broadening and frequency shift associated with two-photon resonance interactions in atomic oxygen and nitrogen.",

Detailed information on the Martian moon Phobos is limited even though it is considered an important destination for near term human exploration. A PHLOTE spacecraft would perform fixed point station keeping at the Mars/Phobos L1 point to allow a tethered sensor package to &#x1c;float&#x1d; just above the moon&#x19;s surface and also park instruments on the surface for in situ science measurements. This can include ground penetrating radar for subsurface composition measurements to determine how thick the layer of fine grained regolith is for future landings. Other key instruments would be dosimeters for understanding the radiation environments for future human missions, cameras, and a spectrometer for surface mineral analysis. If deployed after a human landing, a PHLOTE spacecraft could provide a constant &#x1c;eye in the sky&#x1d; for ground controllers to monitor mission deployments and operational activities. The PHLOTE mission concept has only now become feasible due to recent technology advances, many of which have been supported by NASA&#x19;s STMD. Key technologies that make this mission concept feasible include: The Navigation Doppler Lidar (NDL) Sensor for the providing precise spacecraft position and rate knowledge relative to Phobos. This high precision is needed to maintain position at the L1 point; Carbon Nanotube (CNT) braided yarns for a structurally strong tether that doubles as a power and data conduit, Ultralightweight solar arrays, and highly efficient electrospray micro-propulsion thrusters for long term &#x1c;hover mode&#x1d; station keeping. The Martian Moon Phobos offers a key waypoint toward enabling human surface landings on Mars. In particular Stickney Crater, which always faces Mars due to Phobos&#x19; synchronous rotation, provides an excellent stepping stone destination as a precursor to a human Mars landing. There is very limited information on the composition and the environments at Stickney Crater on Phobos. Since Phobos has a composition similar to carbonaceous chondrite meteorites, it is believed that it could provide minerals that can be used for In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU) to recover key elements such as Oxygen for use as return trip propellant. The mission concept below would answer many of these questions as well as provide TRL advancement in key technology areas for human exploration. This mission concept is a synthesis of new technologies that would provide a unique platform for multiple sensors directed at Phobos as well as Mars. Since the Mars/Phobos L1 point is only ~3.1 km from the surface of Phobos, the PHLOTE tether length only needs to be a few kilometers long. A tether configuration with its Center of Gravity at the Mars/Phobos L1 point can place a sensor package on the moon&#x19;s surface or float it just above. Due to Phobos&#x19; very low gravity, the tether will be under very low tensile loads. Using a longer tether, this concept can be similarly used for other missions such as Mars/Deimos or at the Pluto/Charon L1 point where both bodies are tidally locked which means a PHLOTE spacecraft with a much longer tether could descend into Pluto&#x19;s tenuous atmosphere and sample its chemistry at all elevations unlike a traditional probe. If selected, a feasibility study for the Phobos L1 Operational Tether Experiment (PHLOTE) mission would be performed that will define the PHLOTE mission, determine the technology needs and assess the technology readiness. The study would also model the system, identify risks, as well as explore new science opportunities that could be done with this unique sensor platform.",

      "description": "Earth&#x19;s stratosphere is similar to the surface of Mars: rarified air which is dry, cold, and irradiated. E-MIST is a balloon payload that has 4 independently rotating skewers that hold known-quantities of spore-forming bacteria isolated from spacecraft assembly facilities at NASA. Knowing the survival profile of microbes in the stratosphere can uniquely contribute to NASA Planetary Protection for Mars. Objectives 1. Collect environmental data in the stratosphere to understand factors impacting microbial survival. 2. Determine % of surviving microbes (compared to starting quantities). 3. Examine microbial DNA mutations induced by stratosphere exposure. Introduction: We designed, built and flew a self-contained payload, Exposing Microorganisms in the Stratosphere (E-MIST), on a large scientific balloon launched from New Mexico on 24 Aug 2014 [1]. The payload carried Bacillus pumilus SAFR-032, a highly-resilient spore-forming bacterial strain originally isolated from a NASA spacecraft assembly facility. Our balloon test flight evaluated microbiological procedures and overall performance of the novel payload. Measuring the endurance of spacecraft-associated microbes at extreme altitudes may help predict their response on the surface of Mars since the upper atmosphere also exerts a harsh combination of stresses on microbes (e.g., lower pressure, higher irradiation, desiccation and oxidation) [2]. Materials and Methods: Our payload (83.3 cm x 53.3 cm x 25.4 cm; mass 36 kg) mounted onto the exterior of a high altitude balloon gondola. Four independent &quot;skewers&quot; rotated 180&#xb0; to expose samples to the stratosphere. During ascent or descent, the samples remained enclosed within dark cylinders at ~25 &#xb0;C. Each skewer had a base plate holding ten separate aluminum coupons with Bacillus pumilus spores deposited on the surface. Before and after the flight, B. pumilus was sporulated, enumerated and harvested using previously described techniques [3&#x13;5]. Major payload components were a lithium-ion battery, an ultraviolet (UV) radiometer (400 to 230 nm), humidity and temperatures sensors, and a flight computer. During the test flight, samples remained in a sealed position until the payload reached the lower stratosphere (~ 20 km above sea level). Next, the flight computer rotated the skewers into the outside air. After a short rotation demonstration (2 seconds), all skewers reverted to the closed position for the remainder of the flight. The payload continued floating at an altitude of 37.6 km for 4 hours before beginning a 23 minute descent on parachute. Results and Discussion: Our first test flight examined unknowns associated with sample transportation, gondola installation, balloon ascent/descent, and time lingering in the New Mexico desert awaiting payload launch and recovery. We created a batch of experimental control coupons (each containing approximately 1 x 106 spores) used throughout the investigation for ground and flight test purposes. Several treatment categories were evaluated: Lab Ground Coupons (kept in the KSC laboratory); Transported Ground Coupons (traveled to New Mexico and back but not installed in payload); and Flight Coupons (flown). A subset of coupons from each treatment category were processed, resulting in statistically equivalent viability (Kruskal&#x13;Wallis rank-sum test at a 95% confidence level). Taken together, nearly identical viability from all coupons indicate that balloon flight operations and payload procedures did not influence spore survival. A negative control (blank, sterile coupon) was also flown to verify payload seals prevented outside contamination. A species-specific inactivation model that predicts the persistence of microbes on the surface of Mars is one of many possible outcomes from balloon experiments in the stratosphere. The simplicity of the payload design lends itself to customization. Future investigators can easily reconfigure the sample base plate to accommodate other categories of microorganisms or molecules relevant to the Planetary Protection community. If future flights exposed microbes for hours, we would expect to see a rapid inactivation. Smith et al. [6] simulated stratospheric conditions and measured a 99.9% loss of viable Bacillus subtilis spores after only 6 hours of direct UV irradiation. Earth&#x19;s stratosphere is extremely dry, cold, irradiated, and hypobaric, and it may be useful for microorganisms isolated from NASA spacecraft assembly facilities to be evaluated in this accessible and robust Mars analog environment. A second, science test flight launching from Ft. Sumner, NM, is scheduled for September 2015. References: [1] D. J. Smith et al. (2014) Gravitational and Space Research, 2, 70&#x13;80. [2] D. J.

This problem increases dramatically as mission duration and distance from the earth increases, as in missions to Saturn or Titan.

This represents approximately 35 kg of additional mass at launch solely for the storage of make-up hydrogen to maintain buoyancy of the craft on Titan for a one-year mission. During the Phase I project Lynntech demonstrated that hydrogen can be generated in-situ directly from the Titan atmosphere from 100 K to 300 K with 10 watts using proprietary plasma reformation techniques, and that metal hydrides are viable hydrogen separation devices. Lynntech&#x27;s low volume, low mass (~2 kg) system will save approximately 33 kg at launch ( &gt;$72M) for a one year Titan mission.

Currently, oxygen is recovered as water using the Sabatier reduction process. One of the by-products of this reaction is waste methane, which is vented into space. Lynntech proposes to reclaim the hydrogen from the methane by utilizing a low power, high efficiency, non-thermal plasma (NTP) process based on high frequency dielectric barrier discharge (HFDBD). The HFDBD is characterized by electrons and heavy particles being in thermodynamic non-equilibrium. The electron temperatures are near 10,000K, while the ions and neutrals species remain at ambient temperature. The high energy electrons have the potential to recover up to 75% of the hydrogen from methane. Since the majority of the electrical energy in the discharge is used to accelerate electrons rather than heat the plasma gas, Lynntech&#x27;s process produces minimal soot. Hence, a complex filtration system to remove soot from the exhaust stream is not required. Recovery of hydrogen from methane minimizes the hydrogen resupply requirements and improves the efficiency of the Sabatier process by closing the mass loop of the reduction reaction.",

The goal of this project is to dramatically advance the fidelity of these simulations towards simulating actual extra-terrestrial soil compositions with broad shape and size variations. This will be achieved through applying recent, novel particle kinetics modeling concepts to formulate granular flow physics models for both, realistic irregular particle shapes and realistically dispersed particle size distributions. The proposed technology development will result in unprecedented computer modeling capability for predicting liberation and flow of realistic granular material compositions in extreme extra-terrestrial environments.",

      "description": "The processing of carbon dioxide is a continuing NASA need, ranging from separation processes to remove it from cabin air, to reaction processes that convert the Martian atmosphere to fuels. In support of future habitation activities on Mars, it is desired to process this high Martian concentration of carbon dioxide to ethylene, a chemical precursor that can be used to subsequently produce plastics including polyethylene, propylene, and polypropylene for building structures. Additionally, ethylene can be readily converted to ethanol and subsequently to sugar, nutrients that support biohabitation. Toward this goal, Reactive Innovations, LLC proposes to develop an electrochemical micro-channel reactor that can convert carbon dioxide to ethylene. The modular architecture of the micro-channel reactor enables the system to be scaled to increase throughput while the small feature sizes of the reactor enhance thermal and mass transfer processes increasing the ethylene yield. During this Phase I program, the electrochemical reactions will be optimized to convert CO2 to ethylene maximizing the yield and rate. Single channel and multiple micro-channels will be produced using a new fabrication process that produces channels on the order of 100 microns wide. Characterization of the micro-channel reactor operating conditions will be conducted while producing ethylene to aid in scaling the process to larger production rates. Conversion of ethylene to polyethylene plastic will subsequently be demonstrated.",

      "description": "Long-duration human exploration and habitation on other planets such as Mars will require not only bringing supplies, but also the ability to use local resources to manufacture needed mission products. In situ resource utilization and manufacturing can lead to substantial mass and volume savings, and increase mission self-sustainability. Example mission materials needed include food and nutrients, polymers (plastics), medicines, fuels, binders and various feedstock chemicals. The overarching goal of this project is to develop and demonstrate advanced biological systems that utilize local resources to manufacture high-value products on demand. In many cases, biological systems are either cheaper than competing physico-chemical systems or are the only known method of production. A major project task includes developing methods that efficiently and rapidly convert carbon dioxide and hydrogen to organic substrates that microbes can use to grow and make mission products. Carbon dioxide is the primary component of the Martian atmosphere and is therefore an abundant source of carbon and oxygen. Hydrogen can also be obtained from locally-sourced water. Together, these molecules can form the basis for a wide array of products that support human missions. Another major goal of this project is to demonstrate the ability to engineer microorganisms that produce human nutrients on-demand. Providing nutrition on long-duration missions via stored dehydrated food or by growing plants may lead to deficiencies in certain vitamins/nutrients. We are therefore demonstrating the capability to rapidly generate a specific carotenoid (an anti-oxidant) using an engineered yeast grown on an edible dehydrated media. This includes an initial demonstration on the International Space Station over the course of several years to investigate long-duration storage of the microbes and media, and the ability to produce a nutrient of consistent quality and quantity. These efforts seek to leverage the rapidly increasing capabilities being developed in the private sector, academia, and National Laboratories regarding genetic engineering, bioinformatics, advanced manufacturing and processing, and chemical engineering techniques. Together, with intentional collaboration, these research areas will spur novel technologies that facilitate microbial bio-manufacturing in space and on Earth.",

      "description": "In a space habitat, air revitalization is a necessary function for maintaining a safe and breathable atmosphere for humans. This functionality includes removing carbon dioxide (CO2) and trace contaminants (TCs), providing oxygen (O2) and nitrogen (N2) makeup gases, and controlling the humidity. In an open-loop environmental control and life support system (ECLSS), CO2 and TCs are vented out of the space habitat, while O2 and N2 are supplied by regular resupply missions. For long duration missions, closing the ECLSS consumables loop has potential to reduce the costs associated with resupply missions by decreasing their frequency and the consumable mass they are required to bring. For future missions with target destinations of asteroids, the moon, and Mars, consumable resupply missions would be logistically difficult, if not impossible. As such, recycling all materials on-board a spacecraft becomes a critical, mission enabling functionality. With respect to air revitalization, consumable recycling largely amounts to reducing CO2 to yield O2. This same process may also be useful for in-situ resource utilization (ISRU) on Mars by reducing atmospheric CO2 to supply a habitat with O2 and propellant. This research proposes to investigate the direct generation of O2 via the reduction of CO2 in an electrochemical cell utilizing an ionic liquid (IL) catalyst. The current method to reduce CO2 aboard the space station is the Sabatier process. This process reacts hydrogen with CO2 at high temperature and pressure to produce methane and water. In order to get O2 from the reduced CO2, the water produced from the Sabatier process is electrolyzed, splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen. Currently, there is no implemented system that utilizes methane space station so this resource is vented to space, resulting in a loss of both carbon and hydrogen. Disadvantages of this current state of the art for CO2 reduction and O2 generation in a spacecraft are requirements for high temperature, pressure, and power usage with a significant amount of system complexity to support the processes. Electrochemically reducing CO2 is normally a very energy intensive process. However, ILs have properties that let them act as both CO2 absorbers and reduction catalysts, effectively decreasing the required energy to recycle CO2. By enabling reduction of CO2 directly to the products of O2 and carbon monoxide (CO), this process eliminates the need to provide hydrogen as feedstock and the need for a separate water electrolysis system to split water into hydrogen and oxygen. Because there are a vast number of potential cation-anion pairs that can be made to form ILs, and because ILs can be expensive and difficult to synthesize, a means of predicting IL properties prior to synthesis would be extremely valuable. This research aims to investigate the properties of ILs based modeling the molecular structure of their cation-anion pairs. ILs that are determined to have favorable properties to CO2 reduction and O2 generation will be studied with respect to their intrinsic properties, as well as their operation through a range of environmental conditions. Improving efficiency and scalability of this electrocatalytic reduction via IL selection and electrochemical cell design are the ultimate goals of this research. While this work will advance technology that can improve upon the current state of the art for CO2 reduction and O2 generation in a spacecraft, it can also be prove beneficial to the energy production industry and to the environment. If electrocatalytic reduction of CO2 can become commercially viable, it will create a new avenue for producing renewable energy and it has the potential to reduce the impact of energy production on the environment.",

The all-fiber amplifier design concept for power amplification of a lower power commercially available tunable laser seed source (master oscillator) uses a single gain stage architecture based on germanosilicate (GeO2-SiO2) fibers specifically designed to suppress stimulated Brillouin scattering (SBS), one of the main factors limiting the maximum output power from narrow linewidth cw fiber amplifiers. The amplifier will be pumped by a fiber Raman laser whose spectral output can be tuned by compressive fiber Bragg grating technology. For this proposal TIPD will demonstrate power levels beyond what has been previously demonstrated for this technique, necessary for pumping the SBS suppressed gain fiber amplifier stage to its maximum potential output power. By implementing techniques for suppressing SBS in highly doped germanosilicate fibers it is anticipated that the amplifier wall-plug efficiency will reach 10%. In addition, the single gain stage architecture is compatible with distortion-free amplification of a phase/amplitude modulated seed source, useful for sensors that rely on sophisticated signal processing for detection. During Phase I, we will validate the broadband FRA proof-of-concept through modeling and benchtop demonstrations of both the power amplifier and tunable pump laser stages. Furthermore, appropriate designs for both the tunable laser source and SBS suppressed germanosilicate gain fibers will be formulated and assessed in terms of performance that best meets the target technical specifications for the FRA for a potential Phase II effort.",

      "description": "Saturn&#x19;s moon Titan is the richest laboratory in the solar system for studying prebiotic chemistry, which makes studying its chemistry from the atmosphere to the surface one of the most important objectives in planetary science. Studying Titan&#x19;s organic chemistry requires landing to sample and analyze fluids, dissolved species, and sediments from Titan&#x19;s seas, lakes, tidal pools, or shorelines. Landing dispersions with existing technology are hundreds of kilometers wide, precluding landing in any liquid body except the large seas at high northern latitudes. Low to medium cost missions require direct to Earth (DTE) communication; seasons on Titan now prevent such missions to northern seas for landings before the late 2030s. With these large landing dispersions, access to shorelines or other smaller features on Titan, which may present liquid-solid interfaces or more dynamic environments conducive to more chemical evolution, is only conceivable by relying on wind drift after landing on large seas. Therefore, there is a critical need for more precise landing capability to explore the unique potential for prebiotic chemistry on Titan&#x19;s surface. We propose technology development to substantially reduce Titan lander delivery error. By far the greatest contribution to this error in past Titan mission designs has been long parachute descent phases (~ 2.5 hours) from high altitudes (~ 150 km) in high winds with large wind uncertainties; therefore, addressing error during parachute descent is the key to enabling precision landing. Lowest delivery error would be achieved with a multi-stage parachute system, with an unguided drogue parachute that descends rapidly through altitudes with high winds, followed by a guided parafoil with a high glide ratio that flies out position error at lower altitudes. Parafoil deployment at altitudes up to 40 km, where proven descent camera technology could see the surface to enable position estimation, could reduce delivery error by 100 km or more. The main risk areas in this concept are uncertainty in the precision of descent navigation and in parafoil guidance and control (G&amp;C) performance. The only possible source of adequate position knowledge is onboard terrain-relative navigation (TRN), using a camera to recognize and track features of Titan&#x19;s surface during descent. TRN for precision landing on Mars is now at TRL 6 and is expected to be at TRL 9 by 2021 as part of the 2020 Mars rover mission. Leveraging that development has potential to make TRN available for Titan at relatively low cost in a relatively short timeframe; however, factors unique to Titan require changes to the design of the TRN system. Parafoil aerodynamic performance has not been characterized yet for the dense Titan atmosphere and parafoil G&amp;C algorithms must be adapted to unique characteristics of Titan missions. We propose to raise the TRL of Titan precision landing from 2 to 4 by developing key elements of Titan TRN image matching and parafoil G&amp;C algorithms, developing models for TRN navigation error and for parafoil G&amp;C error, developing a simulation of end-to-end EDL performance, and using the simulation to estimate and optimize expected landing dispersion, with the goal of showing feasibility of reducing delivery error by at least 100 km compared to Huygens-like descent. Success in that endeavor would enable using this capability for Titan missions as early as launch opportunities in the late 2020s. To achieve Titan precision landing in this timeframe requires starting this technology development now.",

Using a recovery system that enables landings to specific coordinates can dramatically reduce suborbital flight recovery costs, future space return flight costs in the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. It also has potential in the Mars&#x27; atmosphere where a lightweight, low volume flight system such as a parafoil can increase the range of motion across the planet with increased lift or reduced drag. A fabric ram air canopy can be dramatically lighter weight than a foldable composite system while still being able to provide long range glide and descent rate control. Wizbe Innovations has developed a unique, lightweight fabric system to control airflow in textile based ram air canopies.Controlling the airflow provides glide and directional control to improve steering, potentially increase lift, and potentially reduce opening shock. Another potential advantage to moving the controls into the canopy is that it reduces field logistics by reducing retrieval to only the parachute canopy. Wizbe&#x27;s controls are located within the parachute and have no winches, pulleys and wires outside the canopy.",

      "description": "This proposal seeks to advance the understanding of full-scale Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerators (HIADs) in support of NASA&#x27;s Space Technology Roadmap, TABS element 9.1.4, Deployable Hypersonic Aeroshells. The HIAD system is a low technology readiness level (TRL) space technology that has the potential to deliver the size of payloads that will be required for human missions to Mars. The current state of the art Mars payload delivery is estimated at 1.5 metric tons. However, payloads on the order of 20 to 60 metric tons will be required for a successful human mission to Mars. Upwards of a 40 fold increase in payload mass represents a significant jump from the currently available decelerator technology. The HIAD system consists of multiple, inflatable tori that are strapped together other around a rigid center-body in a cone configuration and are covered with a thermal protection shield. The individual tori consist of a flexible fabric shell with integral axial cords that are rigidified by the inflation pressure. The HIAD system offers considerable benefits from traditional rigid aeroshells including a small storage volume and a mass to area ratio that is not constrained by the size of the launch vehicle. The HIAD system can be effective in thin atmospheres. Work to date has focused on quantifying the structural behavior of HIAD materials, structural components and test-scale HIAD structures, (3 m major diameter). Although engineers have had success modeling the HIAD system at the test-scale, there is still much unknown about how the structure will behave at a full or human-scale, (~20 m major diameter). Scalability remains one of the major technical challenges associated with deployable aeroshells. Design exploration and optimization of human-scale HIAD structures are important next steps in the development of the HIAD technology. A critical component is the development of computationally efficient structural analysis methods. Modeling efforts to date have focused on high-fidelity yet computationally expensive shell-based finite element (FE) modeling. This work proposes to develop computationally inexpensive three-dimensional beam-based FE models to analyze the HIAD system. Since the HIAD consists of multiple, slender, inflatable members, it is a good candidate for beam based FE modeling. The analysis tool will necessarily incorporate both large deformations and nonlinear material constitutive relationships to accurately capture the structural response of the inflatable members. The HIAD system will be modeled with torus and strap elements as well as elements between tori to capture tori interaction. The material and component level models will be validated with an extensive set of existing test data. Developing a beam-element-based simulation technology will allow for exploration of optimal HIAD configuration and will greatly enhancing our understanding of the HIAD structure. The use of optimization methods to explore the feasible design space can often lead to non-intuitive designs and configurations. For example, exploring non-axisymmetric designs or designs incorporating a radial spoke configuration from the center body to the outer torus are configurations that have not been considered, but are possible feasible alternatives that can be readily explored with the methods envisioned. Development of a comprehensive beam based FE tool will facilitate the efficient exploration of the human-scale HIAD design space and will increase our understanding of the behavior of the low-TRL HIAD space technology. Major technological challenges associated with deployable aeroshells remain. In order to further the technology and ensure that the HIAD system will one day be capable of accommodating the requirements of a crewed mission to Mars, further investigations into the behavior of the system at the full-scale are required.",

TEST was shown to be a viable, robust, easier to integrate with human Mars entry, descent and landing (EDL) architectures, mass competitive, and potentially less expensive to develop compared to other EDL options. Our goal is to apply the ADEPT concept to robotic Venus missions, establish the entry system characteristics, and broaden the viability of the concept. The proposal will evaluate and establish the applicability of ADEPT by performing trade studies and risk reduction tasks. Design assessment and focused testing will further address key risk areas and demonstrate concept viability. The tasks will address key challenges: 1. Parametric evaluation of the Venus Entry for a range of ballistic coefficient configurations 2. Establish entry conditions and requirements for ballistic and lifting trajectories 3. Develop aerothermal data to establish requirements for loads 4. Assess aero stability and establish payload requirements for Science packaging studies. 5. Establish mass estimate for a range of configurations (2m &#x13; 16m) configurations. 6. Perform exploratory arc jet testing of the Carbon Cloth at JSC arc jet with CO2,depending on the availability and funding for making models. Partnership: Ames Research Center (ARC) will partner with Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC), which will perform Venus science focused trade studies and also act as Science consultant. Johnson Spaceflight Center (JSC) will perform exploratory arc-jet testing in CO2 at relevant conditions for Venus missions. Impact: Limited studies performed to-date show low ballistic coefficient entry environments are orders of magnitude more benign than those associated with rigid aeroshells. Entry load can be effectively lowered from 300g to 25g. Benign entry environment will result in lower development and qualification costs for missions. TEST architecture has the potential for inclusion of sensitive science instruments not possible with rigid aeroshells and also may make packaging easier. If TEST is shown viable for Venus missions, it has the potential to be game changing and cross-cutting for both human and robotic missions to Mars (previously studied), Venus, and by extension to Saturn. As result of this effort, an aerothermal data base for Venus entry was generated and used in establishing entry conditions for assessing the applicability of deployable entry system. The study demonstrated a 6m ADEPT is capable of delivering the same payload as the VITaL study, a mission design study conducted in support of NASA&#x27;s Planetary Science Decadal Study by a National Research Council (NRC) team.

Woven TPS is a concept that leverages the mature weaving technology that has evolved from the textile industry to design TPS with tailorable performance by varying a material&#x27;s composition and properties by the controlled placement of fibers within a woven structure. The woven TPS approach that is being proposed has the capability to address two of the major challenges faced by NASA&#x27;s TPS community: 1. The inability to optimize a TPS material for a given mission due to the high costs and long schedules associated with material development and certification. This drives NASA to utilize unoptimized TPS materials for a given mission which can result in significant weight penalties; 2. The typical scenario wherein NASA TPS materials have no other government or commercial applications and do not utilize manufacturing processes leveraging common commercial processes. Given that there are few NASA missions, and that these missions are years apart, this results in NASA incurring high costs to maintain manufacturing infrastructure or incurring the cost and risk of restarting manufacturing. The woven TPS approach has the potential to tailor a material&#x27;s properties by the accurate placement of fibers of different composition with different spacings utilizing commercially available weaving technology, including equipment, modeling and design tools to optimize the weave. This allows for the control of material composition and density in three dimensions, resulting in tailored material performance. Given that the constituent properties of the fibers are known, in the future with modified tools it should be possible to predict the material&#x27;s performance. This should result in a material that can be optimized for a given mission, and although some testing will still be required to certify the final product for the mission, it should substantially reduce the overall testing requirements and hence reduce the cost and schedule.",

Applications include measuring temperature and thermal inertia to study geology and surface evolution while also performing spectroscopy to study composition of the surface of these objects and their thin atmospheres. Additionally, the ring particles of the giant planets are of interest. Thermal inertia measurements probe the ring dynamics. Spectroscopy using emission, solar reflectance, and stellar occultation measurements of ring particles probe composition. The Planetary Science Decadal Survey strongly emphasizes the exploration of the outer solar system, which addresses some of the basic questions of planetary science: &#x1c;How do the giant planets serve as laboratories to understand Earth, the solar system, and extrasolar planetary systems? Important objects for study: Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn, and Uranus.&#x1d;; &#x1c;Beyond Earth, are there contemporary habitats elsewhere in the solar system with necessary conditions, [&amp;] to sustain life, and do organisms live there now? Important objects for study: Enceladus, Europa, Mars, and Titan.&#x1d; One of the seven proposed New Frontiers missions (the Saturn Probe) aims at studying the atmosphere of Saturn and one of the three proposed large-scale Flagship mission (Uranus Orbiter and Probe) aims at studying the atmosphere of Uranus. Furthermore, looking beyond this decade, the survey reads: &quot;it is important to make significant near-term technology investments in the [&amp;] Titan Saturn System Mission, and Neptune System Orbiter and Probe.&quot; The hyperspectral imager we envision would allow studying the atmospheres of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, their moons and rings with higher spectral and spatial resolution than any other existing technology, and would also be applicable to studies of other outer solar system objects such as Trojan asteroids or comets. Broadband spectroscopy, as offered by the bolometers described below, is vital to studying the thick atmospheres of giant planets and moons because a wide range of wavelengths is needed for probing different depths into the atmosphere. The atmospheres of these bodies are opaque at shorter wavelengths due to the pressure-broadened absorption lines of H2 and He and, in some cases (e.g. Neptune and Titan), methane. High spectral resolution optics, will allow for the probing of a wide range of depths, along with relevant spectroscopy of numerous molecular lines. For this reason, the composition of the atmosphere of the gas and ice giants and their moons has been studied by remote sensing using far infrared (FIR) thermal radiance spectroscopy. The hyperspectral imager we envision would allow studying the atmospheres of Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, their moons and rings with higher spectral, spatial, and temporal resolution than any other existing technology, and would also be applicable to studies of other outer solar system objects such as Trojan asteroids or comets and their thin atmospheres. The unprecedented high sensitivity of the superconducting bolometer technology instrument will allow capture dynamic phenomena or rapidly acquire image and spectra during brief flybys. The main features of the instrument we envision are: (1) broadband spectral range, potentially spanning from the visible (0.5 &#xbc;m) to the far infrared (500 &#xbc;m), (2) one hundred times higher sensitivity in the far infrared than existing radiometers, (3) ten times higher sensitivity than narrow band mid IR detectors, (4) potential for large (kilo pixel) arrays of detectors, and (5) operating temperature of 55 K or higher, accessible using a passive cooling, as deployed on the Cassini VIMS instrument. The high sensitivity of our instrument would allow: (1) resolving narrow and weak spectral features, (2) acquiring spectra in short time windows (such as during brief flybys), and (3) imaging fast dynamic processes, such as moving clouds or storms. The large spectral bandwidth of the instrument would allow acquiring hyperspectral images spanning three orders of magnitude in wavelength with the same focal plane, which avoids the problem of stitching together data acquired from different focal planes (as in VIMS and CIRS instruments on the CASSINI mission. The proposed instrument is based on arrays of yttrium barium copper oxide (YBCO) high temperature superconducting kinetic inductance bolometers (KIBs), which our team had recently pioneered. Each of these bolometers responds to power from the interferometer by shifting the microwave resonance frequency of a resonator in which it is embedded. Hundreds of resonators can be read out on a single feedline because each is assigned a frequency that is distinct from the others. Readout is performed by measuring the transmission of a microwave signal through the feedline. Based on the current performance of high temperature KIBs, we expect these detectors to: (1) operate at 55 K, a temperature that has already been attained by passive cooling on planetary flight missions; (2) be sensitive from the visible to the far infrared; (3) achieve 100 times higher sensitivity than existing detectors operating at comparable temperatures in the far IR; and (4) yield kilo pixel arrays, thanks to a resource efficient multiplexing scheme [8]. The development of the design involves laying out the optics to focus broadband infrared on an array of bolometers, while simultaneously achieving precision interferometry. This also requires optical coupling to the bolometers such as by use of a feedhorn array. A radiator and thermal design to cool the bolometers and optics to the required temperature are also being developed. The bolometer array design is being developed to match the optics. The design is being optimized to meet the power and mass requirements of a planetary mission. Together, these provide comprehensive design for the optical thermal systems of the instrument.",

      "description": "The USEWX project is seeking to monitor, record, and distribute atmospheric measurements of the radiation environment by installing a variety of dosimeters and other instrumentation on Armstrong aircraft. The goal is to routinely provide real-time, in-flight radiation measurements to modelers and the space-weather community. Radiation present in the upper atmosphere is harmful to humans and sensitive electronic equipment. Current radiation forecasting techniques employ data from satellites and ground-based detectors to predict radiation levels in flight. Aviation is trending toward flying at higher altitudes and over polar routes, where radiation events are more likely to occur and obtaining radiation data via traditional means is more difficult. Real-time, broad spectral-based radiation measurements are needed to improve radiation forecasts and space weather understanding. Work to date: The USEWX team has cross-calibrated two gold-standard HAWK Tissue Equivalent Particle Counter (TEPC) dosimeters with the Airborne Radiation Measurements for Aviation Safety (ARMAS) Lite dosimeter in ground-based particle accelerators. The ARMAS Lite dosimeter was developed under the Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) program and has been used to collect data on approximately 50 flights of an Armstrong DC-8 aircraft. Honeywell&#x19;s Thermalized Neutron Measurement (TinMan) experiment has passed the System Safety Working Group (SSWG) review, will be tech briefed shortly, and should be flying before the end of the 2014. Construction of the ARMAS Lite Flight Module 3 and the TinMan have been completed, and both have been flown on NASA&#x27;s ER-2 High-Altitude Airborne Science Aircraft. Looking ahead: The HAWK TEPC dosimeters will be undergoing tech brief in mid-2015 for integration in the ER-2. The ER-2 will then be ready for supporting the Radiation And Dosimetry eXperiment (RAD-X) where the ER-2 will under fly the Langley Research Center high altitude balloon out of Fort Sumner, NM in September 2015. This work will capture a wide range of altitudes detecting radiation and categorizing a significant slice of the atmospheric radiation environment, something never done before. The team will also be using the ARMAS-Lite Flight Module 5 as a self-contained, miniaturized, multiple power and data distribution (NASDAT and Iridium) unit capable of multiple platform dosimeter use. The ARMAS Lite FM 5 can be worn by pilots as well as flown as payload on high altitude balloons, the Armstrong Mars Prandtl-D (AMPD) glider, on any of AFRC&#x27;s Airborne Sciences aircraft (DC-8, C-20, G-III, King- Air, ER-2), as well as on other AFRC aircraft (F-18, F-15) and on cubesats. AFRC is also collaborating with Ames Research Center&#x27;s Education and Intern group doing preliminary work ground work for the ARMAS Lite FM 5 for USEWX. In August 2015, interns from AFRC, ARC, Teachers in Space, USEWX, along with the Questforstars.com CEO and high school students from Earth To Sky Calculus will launch inexpensive dosimeters along with weather instrumentation, GoPro Cameras, multiple location devices, and chemical sensors on a weather balloon. The team will do a mobile weather balloon launch at a site determined by forecasted balloon trajectory provided by weather models and intends to aim for the Edwards Dry Lakebeds to ease in the payload recovery process and prove successful recovery of the payloads. This is preliminary work will pave the way to move the ARMAS Lite FM 5 to the AMPD glider and cubesats. Once the technique is perfected, the team will move to launching the more expensive ARMAS Lite FM-5 on either/both the weather balloons and AMPD glider.

Based on limitations of previous efforts, NASA has requested proposals for a testbed to support CFD validation. Leveraging the results of the Phase I effort, Near Space Corporation (NSC), proposes to develop and operate two full scale Testbeds (~9 m diameter) in order to help validate CFD models for the TSSM Titan Montgolfiere balloon.

Fast response associated with LDOs provide a fast and energy-efficient wake-up, and low noise operation. Lack of high-speed switching and an LC type output filter makes them more attractive for high dynamic range telecommunication signal chain applications. To ensure fault-free operation of the digital cores and memory chips, the supply voltage must remain within a certain error window with minimum deviation under transient events, typical in space application.

Because of recent theoretical and observational advancements within the field of radar meteors, we believe that existing models for the interplanetary meteor environment that are based upon or validated with radar meteor observations (Such as the NASA Meteoroid Enviornment Model MEM) lack important theoretically underpinning, and can be improved. Specifically, we now understand that the plasma generated during meteor entry is highly unstable and turbulent, and the evolution of this plasma, is at all stages largely influenced by plasma processes such as wave and ambipolar electric fields. Yet this has not been taken into account in any detailed radar meteor scattering theory. We propose to use our existing and on-going plasma simulations and models to provide the input profiles of conductivity and permittivity for finite difference time domain (FDTD) simulations which can then interrogate the structure using plane waves that replicate radar pulses over the range of used frequencies from HF to L-Band. Using this approach together with our models for how the meteor plasma varies as a function of both meteor parameters such as size, composition, and velocity, and, atmospheric parameters such as winds/electric fields, density, temperature and altitude, will allow us to understand and characterize the full range of radar derivable information from meteors. Achieving these proposed goals will close the existing information gap and resolve the conflicting observations we have on the interplanetary meteor flux. Our results will provide a revised model for the interplanetary meteoroid environment that will strongly support NASA&#x27;s planned manned and un-manned missions near Earth and to the Moon and Mars.",

      "description": "Many future NASA sensors will employ lasers to measure parameters of the atmospheres and surfaces of Earth and other planets, and to assist navigation and operation of space vehicles and aircraft. These sensors would benefit tremendously from increases in efficiency and laser power, with corresponding decreases in mass and power budgets. A new laser concept capable of generating relatively high pulse energies with over an order of magnitude higher efficiency and about a third of the mass of current lasers is being developed. Conventional solid-state lasers can generate high pulse energies but suffer from low efficiency. Fiber lasers offer optimal efficiency, but they cannot produce required pulse energies for most NASA applications. A novel hybrid fiber/solid state laser for generating relatively high pulse energies with over an order of magnitude higher efficiency and about a third of the mass of current lasers is proposed. High spatial and spectral beam quality of the laser can improve the instrument sensitivity and precision. The new laser architecture can be implemented at any of the fundamental wavelengths of 1.0, 1.5, or 2.0 microns. The successful demonstration of this novel laser will profoundly affect the design of all infrared lasers for a wide range of applications from medical to military, and from telecommunication to manufacturing. Due to much reduced power, size, and mass, this laser will allow for significant cost saving in deployment of instruments in space thus creating new opportunities for Earth and planetary observation systems.",

The goal of this research is to develop a process platform to create fiber optic components that operate in the space environment (radiation, temperature, vibration, etc.) and leverage commercial performance/protocols for data transmission. Our overall goal is to create the market availability of space fiber optic transceivers for backbone data communications operating on standard protocols. This will eliminate current cycle of NRE-funded transceiver developments.

MEDSEM will ultimately simultaneously measure X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), Backscattered Electron (BSE) Spectra, Optical Spectra (OS) and Mass Spectra (MS). During the Phase II project Caltech will build on its transfer of electron-transmissive membrane technologies (Phase I) and further transfer to CL the technology for building an array of miniaturized, high-energy electron optic columns (EOCs) that are encapsulated by the microfabricated, electron-transmissive membranes for exciting XRF from samples in an atmospheric ambient. Electron field-emitter sources for these columns will be procured by Caltech from Stellarray Inc. and integrated with the high-energy electron columns. CL will manage the overall STTR Phase 2 project and assist Caltech in the fabrication and integration of EOCs, perform electron-optical and XRF-generation computer simulations to optimize the MEDSEM design, lead the testing and characterization of the Phase II MEDSEM prototype, and ultimately demonstrate the MEDSEM prototype performance. The 24-month Phase II effort will be aimed at developing and demonstrating a prototype MEDSEM prototype instrument (TRL6).

In the past two decades, the fundamental Viking entry vehicle design has been incrementally improved to increase landing mass capability. Landing additional mass beyond MSL capability has proved difficult in recent years. NASA must start an ambitious testing program to develop Thermal Protection System (TPS) material effectiveness for Deployable Hypersonic Decelerators (DHDs) as a means to dramatically increase mission capabilities. NASA has increased the knowledge base for Non-Ablative Flexible TPS (NAFTPS) materials through the Hypersonic Inflatable Aerodynamic Decelerator (HIAD) Technology Development (HIAD TD) Program. This research proposes to significantly extend the HIAD TD Flexible Systems Development (FSD) plan and improve thermal material response modeling capabilities by creating a Physics-Based Model (PBM) to accurately represent convection and radiation for Non-Ablative Flexible TPS (NAFTPS) materials during atmospheric entry. Rigorous ground-based testing will provide validation and verification capabilities for this computer based, transient heat-transfer model. The PBM will combine many entry physics models together into one simultaneous analysis using an engineering program called COMSOL. The proper governing equations representing the aerothermodynamic environment and the thermal material response behavior during entry will be extracted from Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) tools and inputted into the COMSOL framework. The end product will be an accurate 3-dimensional NAFTPS material response simulation that matches experimental data and can be extrapolated outside of ground testing conditions. The research approach will utilize HIAD TDs predefined NAFTPS material coupon layup and testing schedule while suggesting a few additional experimental facilities. Once validated against experimental data, the PBM will provide more accurate NAFTPS mass estimations which allow for either reduced mass margin or increased payload capability.",

The MIDAS system consists of a thin, deployable, Magnetoshell Aerocapture (MAC) electromagnet coil that is deployed outward from the cubesat body using multiple elastically deployed composite STEM booms. The MIDAS system also incorporates into its structure a high-power cubesat-scale roll-out solar array (capable of &gt;5W orbit averaged power even at Jupiter distances), and a high-power burst-mode Loop Yagi antenna for potential deep-space spacecraft-to-Earth ground link communications. While it will not be investigated in the proposed Phase I workplan, previous research at MSNW indicates that the MIDAS technology may also be able to provide shielding against solar flares and planetary radiation belts. The goal is to package this system into 2-3U of a 6U cubesat for missions to Mars, Venus, or Europa. The Phase I workplan will focus on sizing the MAC coil, creating an Active Aerogravity Tour (AATOUR) design tool for sizing MAC hardware for aerocapture missions, designing and sizing the MIDAS structure, analyzing the burst-mode Loop Yagi system to verify it can close a useful data link with Earth (and vice versa), and then designing and prototyping the MIDAS system for packaging and deployment. The Phase I efforts will culminate in the deployment testing of a full-scale MIDAS system. If completed successfully, the Phase I effort will raise the system from a TRL of 2 to 3. Follow-on Phase II efforts will develop and perform development tests on a full Brassboard MIDAS demonstration system, raising the system to a TRL of 4 or 5.",

Often, this involves semi-autonomous exploration to collect a representative set of different scenes and objects so that research scientists and mission controllers can decide what regions are of particular interest and should be explored further. The lack of bandwidth to transmit all this data back from deep space has prompted the need to determine what data is relevant, important, and interesting enough to be sent back immediately. A common understanding among potential consumers (including the general public) of what signifies as an image or sensor reading of value is needed. To make these decisions quickly, the data needs to be presented intuitively using a common semantic vocabulary that describes interesting or anomalous features or events (e.g., composition of a certain mineral above some threshold, visual evidence of terrain features created by moving water, or a volcanic eruption in real-time during an orbital pass) so that opportunities for further inspection and analysis are not lost to long transmission times. We propose a framework for onboard intelligent data understanding algorithms to mitigate this opportunity risk and improve collection efficiency and effectiveness by summarizing the data and enabling the download of a subset containing the most valuable portions called Discovery of Interesting Patterns and Semantic Analysis in Remote Space (DIPSARS). DIPSARS is a framework for semantically characterizing, detecting, and fusing interesting and anomalous 1D sensor measurements and 2D imagery onboard remote spacecraft and planetary rovers to conserve transmission bandwidth. We do this by summarizing data events so that mission controllers and research scientists can analyze representative feature data and provide instructive feedback to seize emergent opportunities for data collection.",

The instrument (initially at TRL-2) will use a new type of scintillator, Cs2YLiCl6:Ce (CLYC). CLYC is self-annealing at room temperature and provides both high efficiency detection of neutrons and excellent energy resolution for gamma-rays. The proposed work will investigate the use of a CLYC scintillator with a cosmic-ray background source as well as with an active pulsed neutron generator (PNG) source of neutrons for geochemical analysis. Our goal is to progress the overall instrument package (detector and PNG) to TRL-4. The ability of CLYC to detect both neutrons and gamma-rays (with a photomultiplier tube) has been demonstrated via a previously awarded NASA SBIR to RMD, thus we assert CLYC at TRL-3. The use of CLYC with a PNG is at TRL-2, and our proposal will develop timing-based electronics for the coupled system and perform testing in a laboratory environment, resulting in an overall instrument at TRL-4. Description of Methodology to be used: Task 1: Monte-Carlo modeling to determine optimal detector size based on minimum planetary radius and mission parameters as well as a science trade study of D-D vs. D-T pulsed neutron source with variable pulse rates and length. Task 2: Development of methods for maintaining high-performance characteristics of a CLYC detector in the space environment. Task 3: Development of integrated detector and electronics modules capable of operating in both passive and active source modes.

A basic requirement is that samples be returned in pristine, uncontaminated condition, necessitating development of a canister system capable of maintaining cleanliness and seal integrity through a variety of environments. Further development of the Sealed Planetary Return Canister (SPRC), is proposed after a successful Phase 1 program. Besides providing a high integrity seal, the canister incorporates features for robotic manipulation and to allow the sample to be accessed in a controlled manner upon return to Earth. The SPRC seal system addresses the two most significant concerns for planetary samples seal surfaces contaminated by the sample and high pressure due to the phase change of volatiles. The SPRC incorporates a novel sealing system evolved from the only marginally successful Apollo indium knife edge seal approach but with added features to address the difficulties and inconsistencies observed. The indium is contained within a protective barrier to prevent against contamination, and the knife edge is mechanically cleaned during the sealing process. The container body can be configured to accommodate a variety of samples including rock cores, rock fragments, regolith, dust, and frozen soil. Atmospheric samples can also be preserved. The design is readily scalable and adaptable to specific missions.

In Phase II we will scale up and refine the coating process, produce sample coupons and heat exchanger cores, and measure the coating performance after long-term exposure to prototypical environments.

      "description": "The project objective is to develop and test a sub-scale version of the Maraia Entry Capsule on a high altitude balloon. The capsule is released at 100,000 ft. The freefall portion of flight is used to provide data on the subsystems, dynamics and aerodynamics of the vehicle shape. A parachute is deployed prior to soft touchdown. The test utilizes a prototype parachute and deployment system for the full scale Maraia Capsule. High-altitude balloon flights are an inexpensive method used to lift payloads to high altitudes. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulations permit payloads of up to 6 lbs without requiring any waivers or special permissions. Using such a balloon flight capability, the Rocket University program at Kennedy Space Center (KSC) has collaborated with the Johnson Space Center (JSC) to perform test flights of a sub-scale version of the Maraia Entry Capsule. The Maraia Capsule is envisioned as an entry technology testbed that could be adapted to return small payloads (10-100&#x27;s of kg) from the International Space Station (ISS) or from beyond Low-Earth Orbit (LEO) destinations. The main test objective is to gain insight into the aerodynamic and dynamic properties of the capsule in the subsonic regime. The capsule has been scaled accordingly, resulting in a test article 10&quot; in diameter by approximately 6.5&quot; tall at the 6 lb weight limit. Secondary test objectives include testing subsystems (e.g. avionics, parachutes, and guidance, navigation, and control (GN&amp;C) subsystems) planned for use in future larger scale flights, as well as training and gaining overall experience in all aspects of designing, developing, and testing spaceflight systems. A priori winds and trajectory predictions are used to determine a launch location such that the trajectory and predicted landing location is desirable for safety and recovery purposes. The balloon is filled on the ground and payload lines are laid along the predominant ground wind direction. The system is launched from a large open area in order to minimize the risk of entanglement and jerking of the lines and payloads. The balloon ascends for one to two hours, depending on payload mass and fill volume. Once above an altitude of 70,000 ft, a release command is issued when trajectory predictions show that the capsule will land within the landing zone (or when they are closest to the zone, based on real-time trends). The capsule descends in freefall to 50,000 ft, at which point an autonomous command is sent to deploy the parachute. The ground operator may also manually issue a parachute deploy command at any time. The capsule then descends and lands, with an approximate terminal velocity of 38 ft/s. A separate release command is issued for the Rocket University payload, which contains its own avionics, when landing predictions are such that it is desirable for the payload to separate from the balloon and land. (Note: on Flight #1, this command was issued simultaneously for both payloads. Future flights will permit separate commands for better control of payload landing locations). The parachute system for the Rocket University payload is an inline, pre-deployed system that inflates as the payload descends. The balloon then ascends (now more quickly, with less payload attached) and bursts at (very approximately) 115,000 ft, and is not recovered. The subscale Maraia Capsule includes avionics, a parachute deployment system, communications, power, a global positioning system (GPS) / inertial navigation system (INS) sensor, a GoPro camera, a flight processor, and a data recorder. A barometric altimeter is being added for Flight #2. A number of blog websites and YouTube videos have been posted on the web of other groups and individuals performing high-altitude balloon flights. However, NASA&#x27;s effort is unique because it is pushing the envelope on small high-altitude balloon flights in a few different ways. First, Rocket University has developed an avionics platform that will fly on large-scale balloon flights, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), and rockets. Second, Rocket University&#x27;s approach of using telemetered and recorded GPS, inertial measurement unit (IMU), altimeter, and video data is much more advanced than the typical hobbyist&#x27;s approach of using a cell phone / camera combination tracked via the web. Additionally, this capsule uses a parachute deploy system originally modified from a typical rocketry system using black powder to one using a commanded servo/pin/spring combination, in order to reduce the hazard associated with explosives. Finally, this capsule is a prototype for a potential sample return capsule designed to bring back samples from the ISS, an asteroid, the Moon, or Mars.",

It is semi-stiff so that it can not tangle (a driving design requirement). Because it is a tension device &#x13; it can (in later versions) be easily modulated and controlled to the top of the atmosphere at about 100 km (the von Karmen altitude). Solar sails have beams that would buckle prematurely &#x13; and gas inflation systems would not permit the fine level of control desired. The design is comprised os a 3 layer fabric sandwich that is both high temperature &#x13; and easily to fold into a tight volume. Because of the safety and related complexities of launching &#x13; or deploying &#x13; small satellites from the International Space Station (ISS), it was necessary to devise inherently safe systems that would be compatible with storing and processing INSIDE the ISS. Normally considered propulsion systems would be challenging &#x13; as any leakage, even if a benign propellant were used &#x13; could affect crew safety (e.g., freon system leakage at above volume percentage thresholds). Cold-gas systems would require bulky &#x27;scuba-tank&#x27; -sized high pressure cylinders. And - a solid propellant motor would present obvious risks of premature ignition. Once deployed outside the airlock, a propulsion system would be complex - and have to have a navigation, spin&#x13;up/down, and COM/tracking system. This is analogous to the operational complexity of the original Corona capsules used several decades ago for spy satellites. The Exo-Brake and related Small Payload Quick Return (SPQR) was intended to be both safe and operationally simple. It is a tension-based, semi-stiff parachute that is deployed from an aft cavity of the satellite and dramatically increases the drag. The ballistic coefficient, or M/Cd*A (M=mass; Cd=drag coefficient; A=projected area) is modified to a value of 1-3kg/m2, and perhaps surprisingly &#x13; permits de-orbit and re-entry within 2-3 days. The SPQR &#x13; which will be later tested with the Exo-Brake &#x13; includes a unique self-orienting re-entry capsule (TDRV &#x13; Tube Deployed Re-entry Vehicle) that also departs from the current orthodoxy. Though intended for &#x27;hot re-entry,&#x27; it is also a low-ballistic coefficient device so that peak heating is depressed -because it occurs at the very top of the atmosphere in very low density. The Exo-Brake and related technologies permit unique planetary cube-sat missions &#x13; to Mars &#x13; to be tested and perfected from the ISS. Addendum: The first Exo-Brake experiment &#x13; at small test-scale (8 kg/m2) was launched in late November, 2013 and successfully re-entered on January 6. The next flight test is scheduled for July, 2014.",

      "description": "Nearly all mechanism applications require some form of gearbox. Wet lubricated gearbox technologies are limited to the relatively narrow temperature ranges of their lubricants. Dry lubricated gearboxes have proven to be problematic with poor life and reliability characteristics. Testing has shown that dry lubricated rolling elements can be made to work reliably provided they are operated at conservative contact stresses, however when dry film lubrications are tested under the sliding conditions in conventional transmissions they are no longer reliable. During the Phase I SBIR Rocketstar Robotics developed the preliminary design of a transmission that consists of all rolling elements and has eliminated all of the sliding elements that exist in conventional gearing. The transmission operates at contact stress values that are conservative and within the envelope proven through previous testing to provide reliable performance in rolling elements. The resulting transmission can be provided in a range of sizes and offers considerable torque capability within a reasonable envelope while operating within conservative rolling contact stress regimes at operating temperatures from near absolute zero to over 500C. The development and test of a successful prototype could revolutionize the torque transmission industry and open the door to mechanisms operations over a much broader temperature range than is now possible. Rocketstar Robotics proposes that the design be carried through the detailed design phase which includes detailed analysis models and that multiple prototypes be built of two different size transmissions. The units would then be tested for performance and life over the extremes of temperature from near cryogenic to 500C operation. Rocketstar will build 3 small 100 in-lb units and 3 large 400 in-lb units for testing along with spare splines to allow development testing with multiple DFL types.

This work will create highly sensitive, low-power gas sensors on a miniaturized device. Aerogel has shown excellent gas sensing properties, but has never been incorporated, into such a compact device. This work will be a key step toward enabling distributed sensing networks for continuous habitat and systems monitoring in spacecraft. Additionally, the demonstrated sensitivity of TiO2 to volatile organic compounds exhaled in a person&#x27;s breath could lead to a handheld device capable of diagnosing and monitoring diseases and conditions that give off these organic compounds as markers in isolated outposts where heavy medical equipment is not available. Through the same mechanisms, TiO2 sensors could be used to detect organic, life-indicating compounds on Mars or other planetary bodies. The fundamentals of this research will also help to understand nanostructure development and modification in porous oxides. These advances could later be applied to dye-sensitized solar cells, photocatalytic water splitting, and photocatalytic oxidation for air revitalization, which all require highly-porous nanocrystalline TiO2 structures for efficient operations.",

By selectively targeting absorption lines of key atmospheric gases and their less abundant isotopologues across the infrared spectrum, next-generation TLS instruments can provide valuable information on the composition and origins of bodies throughout the solar system. Lasers emitting in the long-wavelength infrared (LWIR) regime between 7 to 10 &#xb5;m are required to access absorption lines of several compounds of importance for planetary science; however, such lasers are currently unavailable with the low power consumption required for in situ instrument payloads. We propose to develop single-mode lasers based on semiconductor quantum cascade (QC) structures with emission wavelengths in the 7 to 10 &#xb5;m spectral range. The laser sources will be designed specifically for module power consumption below 1 W at realistic instrument heat-sink temperatures, while targeting molecular absorption lines of interest for high-priority planetary missions. We will leverage the recent experience of the proposal the team members from JPL in successfully developing low-power mid-infrared QC lasers for portable laser spectrometers and the expertise of the team members from Eos Photonics in designing their proprietary high-efficiency QC active region structures. The proposed LWIR lasers will enable the development of tunable laser spectrometers for New Frontiers and Discovery missions, specifically to study the abundance and isotopic composition of sulfur dioxide for the New Frontiers Venus In Situ Explorer and isotopologues of ammonia and phosphine for the New Frontiers Saturn Probe, both identified as high-priority missions in the 2013-2022 Planetary Science Decadal Survey.",

This will allow for the competitive merging of remote sensing, laser ranging, and sample collection in one next generation system that could be used to significantly increase value laser systems proposed for future NASA&#x19;s high profile remote sensing, ranging, and sample collection missions. This proposal intends to take an already existing laser-based optical beam trapping system and perform guided research with it to eventually enable missions that will be able to remotely target samples and study them over extended distances. This would be accomplished by conducting fundamental research in the field of optical trapping that would primarily focus on increasing the range and quality of the trapping beam so it will be practical for a mission. On top of the trapping capability of the technology being researched, it has become clear that it is possible to use the same fundamental system for velocimetry and laser ranging applications. By pursuing this IRAD GSFC can choose to use it the system for particle capture missions, docking operations, lander assist, or other ranging appliactions.

All aerospace applications of gearboxes require lubrication, maintenance, and overhaul; and are subject to eventually wearing out due to tooth surface wear and gear tooth fatigue. In many cases the requirements for gearbox lubrication, maintenance/overhaul and service life limits are acceptable; but in some extreme applications these requirements become a severe performance limitation. For example, high altitude long endurance missions (HALE) typically operate at an altitude greater than 60,000 feet and stay in flight for durations longer than 24 hours. HALE vehicles need a lightweight, highly efficient solution to operate slow moving propellers maintenance free for an extended period of time in an extreme environment. We are proposing to develop a magnetic gearbox technology that can meet the needs of these extreme applications. A magnetic gearbox has many advantages over a traditional mechanical gearbox. The different rotating components in the magnetic gearbox will never touch so the only lubrication required is in the bearing systems. The magnetic gearbox will be essentially maintenance-free except for periodic bearing lubrication/inspection. Vibrations that do not exceed the pull-out torque of the magnetic teeth do not add measurably to the mechanical stresses in the magnetic gearbox so fatigue issues will be minimal. If the pull-out (maximum) torque is exceeded the magnetic gearbox will simply skip a tooth and re-engage when the overload situation is resolved. In the present research we have demonstrated an experimental magnetic gearbox that achieves much higher specific torque than any previously demonstrated design.",

      "description": "Knowing the elemental composition of a planetary surface is key to understanding its formation and evolution. Planetary gamma-ray spectroscopy is a well-established technique for remotely measuring planetary elemental concentrations. It is unique among the available techniques in that it measures bulk concentrations to depths of tens of cm (in contrast to techniques sensitive only to the top tens of microns) and can quantify compositional stratigraphy within this depth range. Orbital gamma-ray measurements have resulted in significant discoveries from the Moon, Mars, Mercury, and asteroids. Gamma-ray spectroscopy can provide foundational science results for future missions such as landers, rovers and orbital reconnaissance missions at a wide variety of planetary bodies. However, many of these missions will be resource limited; present gamma-ray instruments have relatively large mass and power requirements that will limit their use to missions with large available resources. &#x27;GeMini Plus&#x27; is a new type of gamma-ray spectrometer that brings the power of high-resolution germanium to missions with low resources (2.5 kg, 5.5 W). Gemini Plus uses a cryogenically cooled, high-purity Ge (HPGe) sensor to measure gamma rays with an energy resolution and precision that is unmatched by any other technology. This new instrument represents a significant reduction in resources compared to equivalent heritage instruments (&gt;10 kg, &gt;16 W) and opens the possibility for new science objectives not previously available to resource-limited missions such as small, landed packages. Although HPGe sensors have been successful on previous missions, a remaining challenge is preserving their pre-launch performance throughout long-duration missions. In particular, HPGe sensors are susceptible to radiation damage, which degrades their energy resolution performance after long exposures to galactic and solar energetic charged particles. While some operation scenarios limit radiation exposure, for example short cruises (&lt;1 year) and operation in lower-radiation environments (e.g. Mars&#x27; surface where its atmosphere reduces solar charged particle radiation), many mission scenarios (e.g., asteroid belt destinations, Trojan asteroids) have long and unavoidable cruises. Additionally, the adoption of solar-electric propulsion further lengthens interplanetary cruise lengths. To address this challenge, we propose a detailed technology maturation program where we will develop and test hardware and signal processing techniques that mitigate radiation damage in HPGe sensors, preserving laboratory quality measurement capabilities for the target of interest. This work will be accomplished in two main areas. First, we will procure custom HPGe detectors, irradiate them with energetic ions to simulate the relevant environment of long-duration space exposure (&gt;3+ years), and test hardware-based damage mitigation procedures (e.g., repeated high-temperature annealing). Second, we will develop and test digital signal processing algorithms that have been shown to accurately correct signals affected by radiation damage and thus recover energy resolution electronically. Ultimately, these new capabilities will be integrated into a GeMini Plus instrument and fully tested in space-relevant environments (radiation, thermal, vacuum) to validate this technology as TRL6. At the completion of this MatISSE development, the combination of high-value science return, low instrument resources, and simple operation will make GeMini Plus a &#x27;first choice&#x27; instrument for any mission that requires elemental compositional measurements of a planetary surface.",

The effects of this environment has been a topic of research for many years. Issues include the exposure for humans under acute and continuous exposures and the radiogenic cancer risk that rises with total dose and is a limiting constraint on long-duration missions. The proposed metal alloy development produces a material that is multi-functional and light-weight for deep space missions. The target material has a significant reduction in mass and potentially volume for protective performance such as radiation and debris shielding applications as well as potential performance thermally and acoustically. Development of these new Mg alloys will improve the margin and overall risk associated with each of these scenarios by improving the shielding performance and provides a reduction in the likelihood of electronic component failure occurrence as well as a reduction in consequence. Equally important, this will reduce the risk of cancer to personnel from radiation exposure. With respect to electronic systems, the systems that provide life support and are considered critical systems are vulnerable to the ionizing radiation effects as well. Once the &quot;heavy&quot; particles penetrate the electronic components, shorts are created in worst case conditions and provide temporary upsets in the best conditions. Similarly, those electronic systems that are considered non-critical, similar effects are seen but have consequences that effect the mission assurance aspects. By replacing existing metallic components with appropriate Mg alloys, such as the ones from this project, both vehicle weight and crew dose rate can be reduced. The operational benefits of such a change are manifold. For example, weight can be replaced with fuel to achieve greater vehicle velocity. Alternatively, mission duration could be extended while operating within equivalent dose limits.",

Although arcjet testing can be used to obtain some data on materials, the best method to obtain these data is to actually expose them to an atmospheric reentry. The over-prediction of the Orion EFT-1 flight data is an example of how the ground test to flight traceability is not fully understood. The RED-Data small reentry capsule developed by Terminal Velocity Aerospace is critical to understanding this traceability. In order to begin to utilize this technology, ES3 needs to be ready to build and integrate heat shields onto the RED-Data vehicle. Using a heritage Shuttle tile material for the heatshield will both allow valuable insight into the environment that the RED-Data vehicle can provide and give ES3 the knowledge and capability to build and integrate future heat shields for this vehicle. Due to the extreme cost associated with traditional flight tests, NASA has relied almost exclusively on ground based arcjet test facilities in order to develop thermal protection system materials. It is known that the reliance on these facilities has likely resulted in over-designed TPS systems due to the significant environmental differences between ground and flight. Now with the ability to use lower cost devices, such as the RED-Data entry vehicle, the ability to perform actual flight testing on thermal protection system materials may be feasible. This type of data would in turn give a better understanding of how the material behaves during an actual entry and may in turn help with mass issues that would be encountered in flights beyond low Earth orbit. Investigation will be performed on the thermal protection test bed pathfinder by the in-house fabrication of a heat shield from heritage Shuttle tile material that will be designed to be installed on the RED-Data entry vehicle. JSC will obtain the heat shield tile material from the thermal protection processing facility at KSC. Once the tiles are obtained they will be installed by engineers on the RED-Data structure in the thermal protection system lab at JSC. The techniques that are developed from building and integrating this heatshield will allow a process to be developed to build future heat shields out of materials that are being proposed for other reentry vehicles such as Avcoat for Orion. The final product deliverable from the thermal protection test bed pathfinder would be a completed heatshield fabricated from heritage Shuttle tile material. The heat shield then would be installed on a RED-Data small reentry capsule and be prepared for its first flight. The heat shield will include instrumentation that will be used to gain a better understanding of the environment that RED-Data experiences during entry. In addition, a process will be developed on how to build and integrate future heatshields on RED-Data by ES3 engineers. Once the thermal protection test bed pathfinder is completed it will be flown into low Earth orbit. The data that are obtained from entry from this pathfinder flight will be utilized to continue development of ablative heatshield materials that are being proposed for other reentry vehicles including the Orion Multi Purpose Crew Vehicle. This pathfinder project will also demonstrate the capability of JSC ES3 engineers to build and install heatshields on small entry vehicles such as the RED-data vehicle.",

      "description": "Scientific Goals &amp; Objectives: One of the most pressing questions in exploration is whether life exists or existed anywhere else in the universe. Water is a critical prerequisite for life as we-know it, thus targets for extraterrestrial life are bodies that have or had liquid water, i.e. Ocean Worlds such as Titan or Europa. Due to the large radiation fluxes at Europa, or the possibility for burial by aeolian sediment at Titan, the search for life demands the capability to sample subsurface locations. Methodology: State-of-the-art life detection instruments require a sampling system to deliver a subsurface sample to the instrument (non-contact instruments alone are insufficient). A sampling operation normally has four steps: 1. sampler deployment, 2. material excavation, 3. sample capture, and 4. sample delivery. These steps have to be considered in a context of the entire system rather than a stand-alone operation. A review of the sampling approaches deployed on other bodies show that scoops and drills were methods of choice. Scoops were used for sampling loose materials while drills for competent materials. Many adaptations of terrestrial excavation approaches and numerous exotic systems have been proposed and developed in the past. Yet, rarely can they compete with the scoop/drill approach, unless in unique scenarios such as the Touch and Go operations that last seconds. We developed dozens of sampling systems: scoops, trenchers, rasps, harpoons, piercing blades, spinning cutters, clams and others. However, only hammer drills solved all the challenges related to excavation, sample capture, and drop off. In addition, drills penetrated deeper than other systems and were easily scaled up or down to capture a desired sample volume from depth. We therefore propose to develop a drill-based Integrated Sampling System (ISS) for Titan (the system or its subsystems would be applicable to other Ocean Worlds with some level of modification). To date, no sampling systems have been developed that could successfully deal with a range of Titan&#x19;s cryogenic materials: rocks, soils, sticky soils, and liquids (hydrocarbons on Titan). The proposed ISS captures the most promising approaches developed over the past 10 years at Honeybee into a single, fully integrated system. The drill will be baselined to reach 20 cm in depth and capture up to 20 samples 1 cc each, or fewer samples of greater volume. In Y1, we will perform numerous risk reduction tests using existing TRL 4/5 drilling system and various breadboards under Titan environments with appropriate analog materials. All tests will be done at -20 &#xb0;C walk-in freezer with LN2 sample cooling (90K). Heat and mass transfer mechanics are sufficiently similar at 1 atm compared with Titan conditions to allow confident scaling of test results to Titan&#x27;s 1.45 atm, 95% N2 atmosphere. We will study deployment options, drill bit configurations, drilling methods, and sample transfer and drop-off methods. Lessons from this test-heavy phase will be used to trade various architectures and subsequently to develop and test a TRL6 ISS in Y2. Our experience with the Mars Phoenix hardware for Mars&#x19;s special regions (Planetary Protection, cat IVb) will guide materials and design choices. The data will be available to public (via publications) and future missions. The ISS, once at TRL6, would be easily infused into future missions, with little to no modifications. Team: Our team brings expertise in Ocean Worlds environments and science goals, is experienced in the development and testing of planetary samplers, as well as in developing of flight hardware and operating of such flight hardware in actual missions. Relevance to this call: The proposal directly addresses the call: COLDTech seeks to &#x1c;develop and advance sample acquisition, delivery and analysis systems.

      "description": "A new sensor suite is developed to measure performance of ablative thermal protection systems used in planetary entry vehicles for robotic and human exploration. The new sensor suite measures ablation of the thermal protection system under extreme heating encountered during planetary entry. The sensor technology is compatible with a variety of thermal protection materials, and is applicable over a wide range of entry conditions. The project has developed a reliable sensor that measures recession of an ablative thermal protection system used by a planetary entry vehicle. The sensor prototype has been built and tested in an arc jet facility in a flight relevant environment. The sensor suite includes optical sensors that sense existence of ultraviolet emission from high temperature gases in front of the vehicle. As the surface of the thermal protection system recedes, it progressively exposes each sensor and provides timed locations of the moving ablation front. The sensor data does not rely on elaborate data analysis procedure which simplifies interpretation. The sensor suite can also be integrated in a sensor plug that can be readily embedded in a variety of thermal protection materials using proven installation procedures. Using data from the sensor, it is envisioned that the design of entry systems will significantly improve by reducing mass of the thermal protection system. The thermal protection system accounts for 5-50% of the entry vehicle mass, depending on the mission, which could be traded for increased efficiency and performance. It is also likely that existing entry vehicle architectures (build-to-print systems) would realize benefits by pushing the flight envelope to more extreme conditions based on flight data acquired by this sensor suite.",

When passed over a warm ruthenium catalyst bed, gaseous nitrous oxide and an ethylene-ethane gaseous blend combust instantly. A small 1 N thruster can be designed to provide small satellite propulsion systems with a specific impulse of approximately 300 seconds. Both propellants are self-pressurizing, capable of delivering feed line pressures in excess of 800 psi at room temperature, and 400 psi if cooled to 0?C. For longer duration missions, both nitrous oxide and an ethane-ethylene fuel blend do not require thermal heating to maintain a liquid state, and as such, can be stored on Earth or in space for in-definite periods of time with no parasitic power drain required to maintain a liquid propellant. Compared to other available chemical propulsion systems, a NEERHI system offers a cost effective solution as other hypergolic engines use hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide which are toxic and dangerous to handle, increasing ground costs. As an added capability, the NEERHI engine has the ability to operate as a monopropellant engine if the ruthenium catalyst be is heated with a bipropellant reaction, increasing the lifetime of the catalyst bed and reducing heating loads on the engine.",

Minimal water is required at start up; operations are sustained by recycling water from the affluent using Paragon&#x27;s spaceflight-qualified humidity control membrane technology.

      "description": "Saturn&#x27;s giant moon Titan has become one of the most fascinating bodies in the Solar System. Titan is the richest laboratory in the solar system for studying prebiotic chemistry, which makes studying its chemistry from the surface and in the atmosphere one of the most important objectives in planetary science. The diversity of surface features on Titan related to organic solids and liquids makes long-range mobility with surface access important. This has not been possible, because mission concepts to date have had either no mobility (landers), no surface access (balloons and airplanes), or low maturity, high risk, and/or high development costs for this environment (e,g. large, self-sufficient, long-duration helicopters). We propose a mission study of a small (&lt; 10 kg) rotorcraft that can deploy from a balloon or lander to acquire close-up, high resolution imagery and mapping data of the surface, land at multiple locations to acquire microscopic imagery and samples of solid and liquid material, return the samples to the mothership for analysis, and recharge from an RTG on the mothership to enable multiple sorties. Prior studies have shown the feasibility of aerial mobility on Titan for larger aircraft, from 10 to 400 kg, but none of these studies were in the size range we address and none addressed the daughtercraft, sampling, and recharging scenarios we address. This concept is enabled now by recent advances in autonomous navigation and miniaturization of sensors, processors, and sampling devices. It revolutionizes previous mission concepts in several ways. For a lander mission, it enables detailed studies of a large area around the lander, providing context for the micro-images and samples; with precision landing near a lake, it potentially enables sampling solid and liquid material from one lander. For a balloon mission, it enables surface investigation and sampling with global reach without requiring a separate lander or that the balloon be brought to the surface, which has potential for major cost savings and risk reduction. Both scenarios can involve repeated sorties due to the recharge capability. Our phase 1 study activities will (1) develop mission concepts of operations for deployment from a lander or balloon to acquire context imaging and mapping data, to sample from solid surfaces and/or lakes, and to return to the mothership to deposit samples and/or recharge; (2) develop a parametric sizing model of the daughtercraft to characterize propulsion, power, range, endurance, and payload capability for total daughtercraft mass ranging from approximately 1 to 10 kg; (3) develop a conceptual design and identify representative components the entire daughtercraft hardware and software system for autonomous mobility, including estimates of approximate mass, power, and energy budgets and producing a representative CAD model; and (4) develop a conceptual design and preliminary CAD model for a science payload on the daughtercraft, including specifying a nominal instrument suite on the balloon or lander, designing a compatible sampling mechanism to acquire solid and/or liquid samples on the daughtercraft, and studying mechanisms and daughtercraft behaviors necessary to transfer the samples to the instruments. The study will be done by JPL with support from AeroVironment for rotorcraft expertise and developing the sizing model. By analyzing Titan&#x27;s surface, this mission concept may teach us volumes about prebiotic chemical evolution on a planetary surface. This concept has potential for affordable insertion into Discovery, New Frontiers, or Flagship missions and could provide a technology validation step toward larger, self-contained Titan rotorcraft missions in the future. The autonomy needed for this concept is also applicable to exciting rotorcraft mission concepts for Mars and to in-situ exploration of Enceladus. It will engage the public and has abundant, compelling opportunities for education and public outreach.",

This facility will include a test section into which third party experimenters can place their apparatus and will be suitable for studying steady or variable gas-solid flows over a 2-orders of magnitude range in particle size and 4-orders of magnitude in solids-fraction at gas pressures ranging from atmospheric to vacuum and flow velocities from a 10s of m/s per second down to stationary conditions. This facility will provide a unique opportunity to gain understanding of the fundamental physical behavior of granular solids in microgravity over a range of solids fractions that are unobtainable terrestrially due to gravitationally induced settling. It will also support study of phenomena occurring in static assemblies of solid particulates and in pneumatic transport. MGMR will support exploration of static, transient, and steady-state flow conditions. In micro-gravity, low speed pneumatic transport can cause aggregation of particles resulting in the formation of gel-like structures which grow to fill available volumes. Such fractal-lattice particulate-gels are a potential blocking mechanism that could affect low-velocity pneumatic transport in human habitation systems and/or ISRU operations on asteroids or other small bodies such as the moons of Mars. Understanding what contributes to the strength of such gels and developing the means to avoid or disrupt them will be crucial for the design of solids transport systems in future ISRU facilities. The MGMR will provide a unique environment for advancement of both fundamental science and of technologies important for the advancement of solar system exploration. The MGMR will also serve as a subscale testbed for the fabrication of radiation shields made from asteroid regolith for human deep space habitats.",

      "description": "The Rapid Cycle Amine (RCA) swingbed has been identified as a technology with high potential to meet the stringent requirements for the next generation spacesuit&#x27;s CO2 removal and humidity control system. The pursuit of this new technology has been driven by mission applications beyond ISS. Those missions will require space walks for use at destinations such as near-earth Objects (NEOs) and surface missions to the moon, Phobos, or Mars. These destinations necessitate that the technology be operable over a wide range of mission conditions and human metabolic loads, and over long durations of time with minimal power and consumable loss. The focus of the Rapid Cycle Amine (RCA) Element is to develop an integrated CO2 removal and humidity control system that can be regenerated in real time during an ExtraVehicular Activity (EVA) event. Not only does this capability eliminate consumables associated with non-regenerable technologies, the RCA eliminates off-suit regeneration that requires ancillary equipment and power, and eliminates CO2 scrubbing as an EVA duration limitation. The amine used in the swing bed also removes water vapor from the suit ventilation loop, thereby eliminating the need for a condensing heat exchanger, slurper, and rotary separator, as is used with the current Advanced Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). Over the last several years the RCA swing-bed technology has gone through a sequence of design, development, test, and evaluation to prove the technology viable for EVA applications. These previous efforts have investigated the scalability of the technology, sorbent canister geometries, flow control valve designs, and process control schemes aimed at optimizing the RCA for system integration into an advanced Primary Life Support System (PLSS). The sequence of development has taken the technology through three design cycles. Attributes of three generations of hardware, RCA 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0, are given in the table below. Significant accomplishments since the beginning of the project include: Completion of testing of first generation hardware (RCA 1.0). Data were used to inform the design of second generation hardware and develop algorithms for its control system. Design and fabrication of second generation hardware (RCA 2.0). The project&#x27;s target of a mass reduction of 67% as compared to the state-of-the-art (SOA) was exceeded. Integration of the RCA 2.0 test article into the PLSS 2.0 test article and completion of performance testing as part of the integrated test. At the completion of this testing the RCA reached a TRL of 5. Design and fabrication of the Suited Manikin Test Apparatus (SMTA) and Ventilation Test Stand. Design of third generation (RCA 3.0) hardware. Differences between RCA 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0 are given below. Fabrication and life testing of the RCA 3.0 valve assembly. Fabrication of the full RCA 3.0 test article is expected to be completed in February 2015. This unit will be rated for use with 100% oxygen. Once environments testing has been completed and following future human testing (to be conducted by the AES Advanced Space Suit Project) RCA 3.0 will be at a TRL of 6. The SMTA and Ventilation Test Stand were developed to perform unit functional testing of RCA hardware with a simulated relevant environment. The SMTA makes use of a Space Suit Assembly Simulator (SSAS) to provide an accurate atmospheric volume. A manikin inside the SSAS simulates a crew member&#x27;s displacement of atmospheric volume, and duplicates ventilation flow patterns in a similar way that a crewmember would in a donned suit. In addition, the manikin is configured to simulate human breathing patterns. Environmental conditions within the SMTA are controlled and include pressure, humidity, CO2 partial pressure and temperature. The manikin wears a Liquid Cooling and Ventilation Garment. A range of human metabolic loads can be simulated. For cost and safety, the systems will operate with an internal atmosphere of nitrogen or air, as they have not been designed for use with 100% oxygen. The RCA uses a multi-chambered ball valve assembly to switch ventilation loop flow between its two beds. While one bed is open to the suit to scrub CO2 and moisture, the second bed is desorbing to space vacuum. Accelerated life testing was performed on a high fidelity valve assembly for RCA 3.0. The testing was performed for design validation, to mitigate risk of valve failure and to identify any potential unexpected wear internal to the assembly. Because the valve is expected to cycle 40 to 50 times per EVA, and the RCA is rated for 100 EVAs, the valve assembly is expected to experience approximately 5,000 valve cycles over its lifetime. The valve was cycled at an accelerated rate over a period of about 4 months, completing 105,089 cycles, about 21 times the rated design life. Leakage remained within specifications during this period. The valve assembly is currently being dismantled for observation of any wear on critical parts.",

Based on the success of the current Mars Science Laboratory rover instrument ChemCam, the first ever laser-based spectrographic system to be selected as an instrument on a NASA spacecraft, the Hawaii Institute of Geophysics and Planetology (HIGP) has developed and tested a prototype instrument. This new instrument is capable of at least 10,000 times greater sensitivity than the ChemCam instrument, allowing faster measurements up to 8 m away with a focused laser beam. This integrated, compact remote instrument is called the Compact integrated instrument for Remote Spectroscopy Analysis (CiiRSA). Replacing the existing laser with the Q-Peak proposed laser will reduce CiiRSA&#x27;s weight by 30 % and volume by 20 %.

      "description": "Photovoltaics (PV) is a rapidly developing field that has found a vast range of applications, from handheld devices to providing auxiliary power for residential homes to large scale utility power. Harnessing solar energy is also critical for operating extraterrestrial spacecraft and modules. For instance, the International Space Station operates on 110 kW of electricity generated by 262,400 silicon solar cells at an average conversion efficiency of 14.2%, making it currently the largest solar array in space. Other major space technological milestones, such as the Hubble Space Telescope and Mars Curiosity rover, rely solely on power generated by PV. Modules are produced from the highest quality materials to ensure reliable, long-term power is provided to these crafts. But this current technology is reaching the limits of meeting the power generation needs of future space technologies. The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) will require a variety of new PV materials which include those that are extremely lightweight, re-stowable, dust-tolerant modules that generate more than 100 kW, withstand temperatures below -150&#xb0;C and above 200&#xb0;C, and are operational at distances farther than 3 Astronomical Units from the Sun to power the next generation of space exploration. Currently modules are comprised of single and multi-junction cells incorporating expensive materials like III-V semiconductors, gallium arsenide and indium phosphide, and crystalline silicon. An alternative is to use 2nd-generation photovoltaic cells, also called thin-film cells, manufactured with minimal amounts of material on both flexible and rigid substrates, which meet the requirements for lightweight and storable modules for next-generation spacecraft. This category of PV devices is constantly growing with the discovery of new materials for harnessing the Sun&#x19;s energy. For example, organometallic halide perovskites have stirred huge interest within the PV community since their introduction in 2009 with devices that exhibited conversion efficiencies of only 3.9% at standard AM 1.5 conditions. Fast forward to 2015, the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) recently documented a champion device with an efficiency of 20.1%. Perovskite photovoltaic cells have been cited for their advantageous open-circuit voltage around 1 V and a range of available band-gaps between 1.5 and 2.5 eV. The material also benefits from the ability to be formed from solution-based deposition techniques at atmospheric conditions and only requires annealing temperatures around 100&#xb0;C. In contrast, PV cells produced from III-V semiconductors require extreme manufacturing conditions, contributing to their high cost. Proponents of this new material correlate these characteristics to easy scale-up manufacturing and inexpensive modules. Furthermore, the perovskite materials provide numerous opportunities for research to address increasing their long-term stability and understanding of how the material&#x19;s chemical, optoelectronic, and structural properties contribute to high performing PV devices. The lack of an in-depth exploration into the field has prompted our investigation into the characterizing the material properties of thin-film organometallic halide perovskites, primarily those that are comprised of a mixture of two of the following halides: chlorine, iodine, and bromine. This project will involve three tiers: 1) characterizing the structural, chemical, and optical properties of the perovskite films where the chloride to iodide, iodide to bromide, or bromide to chloride ratios are varied from zero to unity, 2) incorporating the mixed-halide perovskite films into solar cells and characterizing the change in performance with the halide ratios, and 3) correlating how the performance of these devices change when exposed to different temperatures, humidity levels, and atmospheres. Materials characterization will employ an extensive library of techniques. Changes in the crystallographic structure of the materials will be determined using X-ray diffraction and optical properties will be evaluated using ellipsometry and UV-Vis spectrophotometry techniques. X-ray florescence, energy-dispersive spectroscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy techniques will be used to characterize changes in chemical properties. Operational lifetime of devices in simulated terrestrial and extraterrestrial environmental conditions will also be noted. The expected outcome of this investigation is to determine if the properties of the mixed-halide organometallic halide perovskites used in PV devices support their use in the next generation of space PV modules.",

      "description": "Previous analyses of the ~4 Ga Martian meteorite ALH84001 have revealed magnetite in carbonate &#x27;blebs&#x27; strikingly similar to those made by magnetotactic bacteria on Earth (McKay et al., 1996). Additionally, clumped-isotope studies have shown the carbonates precipitated at temperatures &lt; 20&#xb0;C (Halevy et al., 2011), consistent with paleomagnetic analyses indicating that the interior of the meteorite was not heated to temperatures exceeding 40&#xb0;C (Weiss et al., 2000). Great debate has raged concerning the possible preserved biological magnetites trapped in the carbonate blebs along fracture surfaces in this meteorite. Two leading hypotheses exist to explain the magnetite crystals associated with the carbonate blebs: formation through alteration of the carbonate and pyroxene in the bulk rock (Treiman and Essene, 2011) and deposition of mature magnetite in an aqueous solution (Thomas-Keprta et al., 2009). The latter hypothesis is consistent with a biogenic origin for some of the magnetite crystals. The two distinct scenarios would lead to dramatically different magnetization properties, which can be measured and characterized in the laboratory to discriminate between the hypotheses. The former leads to intense relative magnetizations, while the latter leads to much weaker remanence. A robust analysis based on this difference, which distinguishes between chemical and depositional magnetization, is the Fuller et al. (1988) test of natural remanent magnetization. Similarly, the susceptibility of anhysteretic remanence (ARM) directly measures the microscopic clumping (nearest-neighbor) arrangement of single-domain magnetites, via the Cisowski (1981) ARM acquisition test. Detrital magnetites should clump together magnetostatically during transport (e.g., Kobayashi et al., 2006), whereas exsolved magnetites should remain spatially separate. Thus far, the small size and associated magnetization of the blebs have precluded any paleomagnetic or rock-magnetic studies on the carbonates themselves; however, the new ultra-high resolution scanning superconducting magnetic microscopes have increased our measurement sensitivity 4 orders of magnitude over conventional superconducting magnetometers. With this instrument, we have demonstrated recently the ability to measure quantitatively the magnetic moments associated with 50-&#xb5;m sized ALH84001carbonate fragments. Using these new measurements in conjunction with well established paleomagnetic laboratory demagnetization techniques it is now possible to conduct the critical tests to resolve the origin of magnetization in the carbonates. Through demagnetization and careful determination of the magnetic structures we may also be able to estimate the strength of the magnetic field present during carbonate precipitation (or magnetite exsolution event). The strength of the paleofield is an indication of the ability of Mars to maintain a dense atmosphere enabling habitable conditions. Two main goals exist for the proposed work: determine if the magnetization in the carbonate blebs is chemical or detrital, and determine the field strength on the Martian surface at the time of carbonate formation, as distinct from the cooling of the orthopyroxene. These goals are directly relevant to two of the research emphases in the exobiology solicitation: biosignatures and life elsewhere and early evolution of life and the biosphere. Terrestrial magnetites formed by magnetotactic bacteria have revealed much information about past environments and the direction and strength of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field. The presence of biogenic magnetites would also give insight to the redox stratification in the environment in which they were formed. Should the magnetites in the ALH84001 meteorite be biogenic, they would have existed long before the earliest known magnetotactic bacteria on Earth, from 1.8 Ga (Chang et al., 1989), and would predate by several hundred million years the first hints of life on Earth.",

      "description": "A spacecraft thermal control system must keep the vehicle, avionics and atmosphere (if crewed) within a defined temperature range. Since water is non-toxic and good for heat transport, it is typically used as the coolant that circulates within the crew cabin boundary. This loop then interfaces with another low freeze point fluid, such as ammonia, for transport of heat to a radiator where the temperatures can be considerably below the freezing point of water. The volumetric expansion during freeze usually prevents its use in external systems since freezing will damage the components. Yet, if the system can accommodate the forces generated by freezing, then selectively allowing parts of a heat exchanger to freeze can be used to passively increase the turn-down of the heat rejection from radiators. TDA Research, Inc. has been developing freezable water/ice phase change heat exchangers for several years that offer several advantages: they can eliminate the need for a separate heavy Freon or ammonia loop; use the buildup of ice to regulate the rate of heat transfer, and the endotherm of melting ice can absorb peak loads from the spacecraft to reduce the size and mass of the radiator. Therefore, TDA Research and the University of Colorado set out to demonstrate a lightweight and freeze tolerant water/ice heat exchanger to passively regulate the heat rejection rate from the water coolant loop of a manned spacecraft to its heat sink systems. The heat exchanger has no actively moving parts and is thus extremely reliable.

      "description": "This proposal offers to provide NASA with an automatic mesh generator for the simulation of aerodynamic flows using Reynolds-Averages Navier-Stokes (RANS) models. The tools will be capable of generating high-quality, highly-stretched (anisotropic) grids in boundary layer regions and transition smoothly to inviscid flow regions even in an adaptive context. The innovation of our Phase II STTR program is to develop and provide to NASA automatic mesh generation software for the simulation of fluid flows using Reynolds-Averaged Navier-Stokes codes. As a result of the successful Phase I work, these new tools are now capable of generating high-quality, highly-stretched (anisotropic) meshes in boundary layer regions and transition smoothly to inviscid flow regions, even in an adaptive context. The significance is that our method has the ability to generate a boundary layer mesh while keeping intact the previous adaptation procedures from non viscous simulations. This leads to a natural coupling between boundary layer mesh generation and anisotropic mesh adaptation. All of the Phase I objectives were met and all tasks were completed successfully. The Phase II project will include improvements in surface remeshing, coding for optimal speed and increased robustness of the solvers, adding a mesh optimization module, providing a link to general CAD packages, include unsteady coupling where the boundary layer mesh refinement evolves in time, conduct further validation and verification on NASA models by running flow cases with our solver, documenting the project, and delivering the new meshing software to NASA.",

      "description": "Geopolymers are inorganic cementitious binders produced by polymeric reaction between an aluminosilica rich material and an alkali metal hydroxide/silicate liquid, forming a binding gel, which can be used to encapsulate fine and coarse aggregates to produce concrete. While earth-based applications utilize commonly available materials, such as metakaolin, fly ash, or even rice husk, researchers have reproduced lunar regolith to make geopolymer concrete specimens (&#x27;Lunamer&#x27;) by activating the regolith with alkali liquid. Geopolymer binder technology presents superior mechanical and thermal performance, and has been shown to be compatible with an abundantly available lunar resource (lunar regolith). The highly conductive geopolymer has been enhanced further for use in electromagnetic (EMI) shielding and electrostatic discharge (ESD) applications. Conductive filler materials (carbon fibers and/or carbon black) were added to the geopolymer matrix. Impedance measurements were performed to determine the conductivity value of different conductive composite formulations. Results indicated that conductive geopolymer matrices are very effective in blocking electromagnetic waves of frequencies greater than 1 GHz. Therefore, to understand space-based applications, next steps should include characterizing radiation shielding effectiveness of geopolymer and &#x27;Lunamer&#x27; concrete. The purpose of this project is to develop lunar regolith based geopolymer concrete and perform differential shielding studies on various geopolymer formulations to determine if sufficient protection from radiation in space environments can be enabled. For the initial testing of these concrete matrices, a variety of locally-available radiation sources will be used. As part of the proposed work, geopolymer and &#x27;Lunamer&#x27; concrete matrices will be constructed and their ability to shield radiation will be evaluated. The geopolymer matrices will be prepared using fly ash as the pre-curser, barite (BaSO4) and hematite (Fe2O3) as the aggregate and metallic chips, representing the state-of-the-art in Earth-based construction practices. The &#x27;Lunamer&#x27; concrete matrices will be made using geopolymerized lunar regolith with entrained carbon fibers and carbon black for EMI shielding and metallic chips. These will include radiation energies within this range of biological interest, but will also include those of lower energies. While such low energy sources cannot be used to correlate the biological impact of high energy radiation, they do provide a useful tool to quantify the relative shielding behavior of different materials.",

MEDSEM will simultaneously measure X-ray Fluorescence (XRF), Backscattered Electron Spectra, Optical Spectra and Mass Spectra. Caltech will transfer to CL the microfabrication technology for vacuum-encapsulating, electron-transmissive SiN membranes, the key enabling component without which MEDSEM would not be possible. Caltech will also transfer the results of electron-optic simulations performed for optimizing the MEDSEM instrument configuration. The 12-month Phase I effort will be aimed at demonstrating the proof-of-principle for MEDSEM via an experimental setup made up of mostly commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) parts: miniature electron sources, an x-ray detector and a double-chambered test setup. High-energy electrons will be generated in the first, evacuated chamber, and these electrons will pass through the Caltech-fabricated SiN membrane into the second chamber (maintained at Martian ambient pressure), to strike planetary analog samples thereby generating characteristic XRF. The XRF spectra will be captured by a COTS x-ray detector which is present in the second chamber. Contingent on a successful, follow-on, Phase II effort, the proof-of-principle experiment will be expanded to demonstrate the remaining simultaneous measurement modalities, namely the acquisition of Backscattered Electron Spectra, Optical Spectra and Mass Spectra.

      "description": "I. Objectives We propose modifications to the operation of the quadrupole mass filter and the quadrupole ion trap. New modes will alter the operating pressure, increase signal/noise ratios, and allow new types of scans, (e.g. precursor scans) in single analyzers. The modifications will include Hadamard multiplexed detection to increase signal/noise ratios and secular frequency scans to record mass spectra as well as MS/MS scans. The experiments will be implemented on both commercial and lab-built miniature instruments. Ions will be generated from solutions and from solids using ambient ionization methods. II. Methods and Technology The proposed work seeks to implement significant changes in the way mass spectrometers are operated to better match requirements of planetary exploration. These requirements include (i) small, light instruments, (ii) tandem mass spectrometry, including product, precursor, and neutral loss scans, (iii) simplified electronics, (iv) higher pressure operation, (v) improved sample utilization, and (vi) wet and dry sample ionization. Secular frequency scans Current benchtop and miniature mass spectrometers will be adapted to perform secular frequency scans using ac frequency ramps. Supplemental ac signals will be scanned across ions&#x19; secular frequencies while keeping the trapping radio frequency (rf) signal constant. Careful control of the amplitude and frequency in the ac signal(s) should allow novel MS and MS/MS scans to be performed, including precursor scans not previously possible in single analyzer instruments. Other scans (e.g. multiple reaction monitoring) are also accessible. These experiments remove the demanding electronics needed for rf amplitude sweep in current instruments. Operation at higher pressures is also anticipated. Hadamard multiplex measurements Secular frequency scanning will enable multiplexed Hadamard &#x18;masking&#x19; detection, increasing signal/noise via the Fellgett-Jacquinot advantage. This will be accomplished by simultaneously interrogating (exciting or ejecting) multiple ions using ac voltages of appropriate frequencies. The use of stored waveform inverse Fourier transform notches should further increase the capabilities of the proposed scans by masking certain values of the Mathieu parameter, q, allowing rapid acquisition of the entire 2D precursor-product ion space. Wet and dry ambient soft ionization Wet samples will be ionized via relay electrospray using a small charge pulse (e.g. a primary electrospray). When this charge is incident on an insulated capillary containing a sample in solution, efficient ionization of the analytes occurs. Plasma methods based on a new miniature desorption atmospheric pressure chemical ionization source will serve as dry ionization techniques for solids and surface films. III. Perceived Impact of the Proposed Work The proposed work will integrate novel scan techniques, including multiplexing, into current quadrupole mass filters and ion traps to increase performance. The incorporation of unique methods of ambient ionization will provide improved ionization for both wet and dry samples. Such a system will allow the detection, identification, and structural elucidation of trace organics on Mars, Titan, and other planetary satellites and meteorites with high signal/noise, all while simplifying electronics. The use of precursor ion scans will facilitate exploration for unknown organics. The experiments will also be performed using miniature systems that benefit from simple electronics and higher operating pressure. IV. Research and Development Team R.

      "description": "A static rock splitter device based on high temperature shape memory alloys (HTSMAs) will be developed for space related applications requiring controlled geologic excavation. The device, referred to as the shape memory alloy rock splitter (SMARS), is intended for sampling geological deposits in extra-terrestrial environments including planetary bodies such as the moon, Mars, and near-Earth asteroids. SMARS will consist of active elements made of NiTiHf alloys that generate extremely large forces in response to thermal input, while providing a dense and cost-effective method for fracturing rocklike materials when compared to hydraulic or explosive-based alternatives. The fractured rocks can be analyzed by onboard instruments on rovers or spacecrafts, or the rock masses can be returned to Earth for more detailed studies and investigations. The active elements will be used in conjunction with custom built, DC voltage heaters that are placed in borehole(s). The active elements can be recovered and are fully resettable for future use without any wasted consumables. Various rock types including igneous rocks (e.g., basalt, quartz, granite) and sedimentary rocks (e.g., sandstone, limestone) will be tested. The shape memory alloy rock splitter (SMARS) is ideal for critical planetary rock drilling/sampling operations, where flying debris from blasting methods can destroy the rock formation of interest, pose safety concerns to the astronauts, or cause damage to the costly nearby equipment (e.g., rover mirrors and sensors). In addition, static SMARS requires little setup and activation time compared to other static methods such as chemical agents that can take up to a few days to react with some hard and unknown rock formations. Mission reliability is another benefiting factor since SMARS operates based on a material response and only requires heat input to activate without the need for complex valve systems or hydraulic fluids, making it extremely simple and essentially fool proof to operate. The small volume and extremely low weight of the SMARS reduces payload launch costs and transportation hazards when compared to heavy hydraulic wedges and dangerous explosive materials and chemicals. Thus, the goal of this work was to explore high temperature SMAs, referred to as HTSMAs, for use as a static rock breaker where higher activation temperatures and higher force generations can be achieved. SMARS developed as part of this work employed Ni-rich NiTiHf alloys that have shown promising results regarding actuation and stability [9] as the expanding members. Along with custom heaters and transportable controller, SMARS key components and performance parameters were evaluated using new material conditioning methods, also known as training, using several rock types.",

When passed over a warm catalyst bed, gaseous nitrous oxide and an ethylene-ethane gaseous blend combust instantly. A small 1 N thruster can be designed to provide small satellite propulsion systems with a specific impulse of approximately 300 seconds. Both propellants are self-pressurizing, capable of delivering feed line pressures in excess of 800 psi at room temperature, and 400 psi if cooled to 0?C. For longer duration missions, both nitrous oxide and an ethane-ethylene fuel blend do not require thermal heating to maintain a liquid state, and as such, can be stored on Earth or in space for in-definite periods of time with no parasitic power drain required to maintain a liquid propellant. Compared to other available chemical propulsion systems, a NEERHI system offers a cost effective solution as other hypergolic engines use hydrazine and nitrogen tetroxide which are toxic and dangerous to handle, increasing ground costs. As an added capability, the NEERHI engine has the ability to operate as a monopropellant engine if the catalyst be is heated with a bipropellant reaction, increasing the lifetime of the catalyst bed and reducing heating loads on the engine. The fuel and oxidizer have nearly identical vapor pressure curves, allowing them to be stored in compact common-bulkhead tanks.",

      "description": "In light of NASA&#x27;s goal for planetary exploration, the development of new technology is imperative. The aerodynamic deceleration technique used during Entry, Descent, and Landing (EDL) plays a vital role in mission success. The concept of interest in the current research is the inflatable aerodynamic decelerator (IAD). An inflatable aerodynamic decelerator is a gas-pressurized device that is inflated at the time of deployment. This technology was born in the 1960&#x27;s, followed by minimal research until the mid 1990&#x27;s. Over the past 15 years there have been many studies that have continued to show feasibility and the necessity of this type of technology. Necessity stems from the fact that the current entry technology is quickly reaching its limits in terms of landing high payload masses on Mars. It is well known that the complex flowfields during atmospheric entry will strongly interact with the structural dynamics of an IAD. This, in conjunction with the inherent unsteadiness of the flow, leads to many challenges in understanding these interactions. Thus, this research proposes to develop a time-accurate aeroelastic model with application to the analysis of inflatable aerodynamic decelerators. This will be accomplished through the coupling of a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) solver and a computational structural dynamics (CSD) solver. The CFD and CSD solvers ultimately used in this work will be selected through close consultation with research partners at NASA. One approach under consideration for the CFD analysis is the use of NASCART-GT, a solution adaptive, Cartesian, Navier-Stokes code developed at the Georgia Institute of Technology. One of the key difficulties in performing aerodynamic analysis of deforming bodies is the fact that the computational mesh must change with time. Using NASCART-GT will provide an automated grid generation process to begin the computational solution. As the IAD is deformed, new surface information must be computed, and the flow solution may proceed. The computed pressure and thermal load distribution over the geometry are input to the structures solver. There are many solvers that exist, with the most likely candidate being LS-DYNA, based on the previous coupling efforts with NASCART-GT. This previous work demonstrated successful coupling to obtain steady-state aeroelastic solutions. The results to date have not included the effects of temperature and heat flux on the IAD. Using a recently enhanced tool in NASCART-GT, which combines an Euler solution with an integral boundary layer method, will provide these thermal effects. The time-accurate, coupled analysis tool must first be validated against either wind tunnel tests or against other forms of reliable computational results. Following the development and validation of this computational tool, analysis on a series of configurations directly applicable to points along a trajectory of interest will be conducted. The specifics of this task will require collaboration with NASA in order to determine appropriate conditions. The proposed research falls under multiple Technology Areas (TA) of NASA&#x27;s Space Technology Roadmap. The primary TA that categorizes the proposed work is TA 9: Entry, Descent, and Landing Systems. Within this category, there are several higher-level areas including the following: 9.1.4 Hypersonic Decelerators, 9.1.6 Entry Modeling and Simulation, 9.2.1 Attached Deployable Decelerators, and 9.2.2 Trailing Deployable Decelerators. Further development of IADs will provide NASA with a suitable means of attaining the goal of planetary space exploration. The current research furthers this endeavor by investigating the complex problems associated with the interaction between aerodynamics and structural dynamics. Results from this work will be able to provide a greater understanding of this phenomenon, as well as the ability to computationally predict these effects.",

Bara (Dept. of Chemical &amp; Biological Engineering) and Prof. Paul A.

Profs. Bara and Rupar offer their expertise in polymer materials in three projects that have been identified and outlined in collaboration with Dr. Enrique Jackson and Dr. Eric Fox from NASA MSFC. Project 1 relates to the continued development of ionic polyimides as feedstocks for fused deposition modeling (FDM) based 3-D printing. Bara and Jackson have previously worked together on characterizing the thermal properties of a range of ionic polyimide compositions through CIF funding over the past year. This CAN proposal will facilitate scale up of material production, extrusion of filaments and printing of demonstration parts in an FDM- based 3-D printer as a viable new material for additive manufacturing during space travel and eventual Mars exploration. Project 2 relates to the use of these ionic polyimides in combination with NASA MSFC&#x19;s custom ionic liquids (ILs) which are able to remove CO2 for atmosphere revitalization and life support. The goal is to stabilize these ILs within the solid ionic polyimide and produce pellets that can be used to remove CO2 from the ambient air within a closed environment such as a space shuttle. Project 3 relates to developing feasible and beneficial uses for Bosch carbon which is a byproduct of the atmosphere revitalization process. It has been proposed that the Bosch carbon may be extremely beneficial within additive manufacturing technologies to support on-demand production of items and parts needed. Through extrusion, Bosch carbon can be directly incorporated into polymer filaments such as ABS or ionic polyimides. Another viable option is to employ 3-D printing to create molds/shells of needed objects and then use the Bosch carbon as a filler for thermosetting materials such as room-temperature vulcanizing (RTV) silicones, thus creating excellent composites that can make use of large amounts of Bosch carbon. The success of this project will benefit specific NASA objectives for space exploration relating to additive manufacturing and beneficial use of Bosch carbon, which might otherwise be considered a waste product. Furthermore, this work will benefit the research mission of the University of Alabama and further the value of existing intellectual property, including issued and pending U.S. patents covering the ionic polyimide material compositions.",

A compact and light weight LiDAR instrument is needed for topography mapping, position sensing, laser altimetry, and autonomous rendezvous of satellites. Missions to small bodies such as asteroids, comets, and moons require precision rendezvous and accurate identification of landing or sampling sites. Precision range data significantly improves spacecraft control in close-approach and landing scenarios. Range data is most critical in the final descent phase where the spacecraft is within a few kilometers of the target surface.

This novel imaging system will include a compact, single camera/single focal plane array camera and end-to-end image processing software to produce, high quality, low noise, high-speed video not currently possible with today&#x27;s technology. The compact cameras will be compatible with existing SSC camera housing, as all acquired imagery will be stored off-camera to prevent loss of information in the event of a mishap. The system will be able to record entire test sequences at 250 fps lasting up to 45 minutes. Most importantly, the system will produce XHDR (&gt;120 dB dynamic range) HD format imagery so that relatively dark test cell infrastructure and test article hardware will be visible alongside exhaust plumes that may also contain hot molten debris with brightness levels approaching that of the sun. Because the imagery will be calibrated, the system will also provide engineering information such as color temperature and particle trajectory velocities. Geometric calibration will enable multiple properly positioned cameras to provide accurate 3-D XHDR image products. Rocket engine certification ground testing requires clear visual high-speed video recording that can capture essential information for NASA during rocket engine certification ground testing. This need is particularly true in the event of a mishap, when investigations into the underlying cause ensue. The cameras in use today at SSC have significant limitations including plume saturation, rolling shutter image wobble, camera geometric distortion, and no off-board storage, which makes it nearly impossible, in catastrophic situations that result in the loss of a camera, to obtain critical information.",

      "description": "Develop the algorithms and prototype software for computing robust trajectory solutions that combines one-way onboard radiometric measurements with optical imagery that is part of autonomous navigation system for deep space exploration. With the advent of NASA&#x27;s Deep Space Atomic Clock, operationally accurate and reliable one-way radiometric data sent from a radio beacon (i.e., a DSN antenna or other spacecraft) and collected using a spacecraft&#x19;s radio receiver enables the development and use of autonomous radio navigation. Autonomous navigation using NASA&#x19;s AutoNav software system (developed by JPL) has been a critical technology for many deep space missions, including Deep Space 1, Stardust, and Deep Impact. For these missions, autonomous navigation was conducted using passive optical imaging of nearby bodies with an on-board camera system. Optical data provides strong angular information about a spacecraft&#x19;s &#x18;plane-of-sky&#x19; relationship to the object being imaged. Range (or &#x18;line-of-sight&#x19;) information, orthogonal to the plane-of-sky, is more difficult to determine from optical data due to parallax issues of observations taken from far distances. A more direct measure of line-of-sight is obtained with radiometric tracking of range and Doppler. These measurements compliment the optical data such that, when combined with optical, yield a more complete, almost kinematic, robust solution for a spacecraft&#x19;s absolute position in space. Indeed, the fusion of these two data types is central to an autonomous deep space navigation capability that will be needed for a wide range of future missions &#x13; examples include autonomous landings on small or large bodies, human asteroid and Mars explorations, and efficient navigation for future orbiters and interplanetary craft. Space explorers &#x13; robotic or human - need to safely navigate the depths of the solar system with the tools available to them. They need reliable, abundant, and timely information telling them their trajectory so that they can plan an effective course. With both the number and complexity of robotic mission operations increasing, and the advent of solar system exploration by humans, there is a need to have robust, fault tolerant, on-board, and automated navigation. The DS-1, Deep Impact, and Stardust missions proved the viability of autonomous navigation, that was even mission critical for defined, short lived mission phases (i.e., chasing the impactor for DI, or comet flyby for Stardust). However, autonomous navigation has not become routine. It is not yet safe enough to &#x18;cut the cord&#x19; with Earthly bound navigators - breakthroughs are required. Another benefit that could be realized with the deployment of reliable autonomous navigation is a significant reduction in DSN utilization via combining optical and radio (with DSAC) data thus reducing tracking requirements in cruise, and, at places such as Mars, taking full advantage of Multiple Spacecraft per Aperture for tracking. This technology task is developing a new extensions to JPL&#x19;s AutoNav that will provide qualitatively new capabilities, crossing the threshold into the realm of reliable and safe on-board navigation by capitalizing on the technology advancement provided by DSAC for conducting one-way radio navigation. DSAC coupled with a capable radio (such as the Universal Space Transponder in development) solves the measurement problem &#x13; routine collection of Doppler and, with some enhancements to the DSN, range are now possible. However, AutoNav cannot yet process this data; enhancements to AutoNav&#x19;s measurement modeling, dynamic modeling, and state estimation capabilities are required. The requisite models exist today in JPL&#x19;s ground software, but these do not take into account the realities of an onboard implementation where computational resources are limited and trajectory solution trending/assessment must occur for specified periods without human intervention. Sufficient models, robust and adaptive algorithms, and solution assessment must be determined and engineered for a successful onboard implementation. The core of this task is analyzing, designing, and developing a protype onboard radio navigation capability and integrating it into AutoNav&#x19;s existing capabilities for processing optical imagery. Key factors that will influence how and what we do: - Radiometric data has information along only one axis (line of sight), and it does not contain as much in any given measurement as compared to its optical counterpart (which has plane of sky sensitivity to the two orthogonal dimensions). However, the radiometric data are an order of magnitude more precise in that dimension as compared to the optical plane-of-the-sky measurements. As a result, radio navigation solutions are more sensitive to modeling fidelity and modeling errors, and will require careful consideration of appropriate models. Examples of modeling issues to consider include gravity field size for an orbiting mission, atmospheric calibration fidelity for planetary approach, or the degree of integration to the spacecraft attitude system. This research is developing a sufficient set of dynamic and measurement model for use in onboard navigation in multiple flight regimes &#x13; cruise, approach, orbit, small and large body. - Radiometric data combined with optical provide position information along multiple axes (not equally so) plus, with Doppler, rate information along the line of sight. Navigation solutions that combine both data types will be more robust, but each will have strengths in different flight regimes. This task is investigating the role that each data type plays in the solution process to aid in identifying sufficient modeling. - Operational robustness requires fault tolerant solutions &#x13; radio and optical complement each other and provide for a natural fault tolerance (different observation systems, different observation quantities). To take full advantage of this will require advanced filtering techniques. Examples include adaptive filtering with multi-model filter banks, measurement pre-processing to determine outliers and trends, post-process solution assessment (consistency and stability), and alternate filter algorithms such as Unscented Kalman filtering or Sigma Point filtering. This task is reasearching these options to determine a best mix of capabilities for implementation. This effort will require restructuring the architecture of the existing AutoNav software as it is, essentially, a point design that is not easily extended. A key aspect of this restructuring is to examine JPL&#x19;s more general purpose MONTE navigation toolkit and the Optical Navigation Program (ONP) and integrate selected components into AutoNav. This will facilitate the addition of not only radiometric data processing but also the more advanced filtering methods. We propose to generalize AutoNav to allow processing of multiple data types, with multiple filter instances, and to maximize efficiency of storage and computations on representative flight processors and memory that we will test via emulation. The state of the art in autonomous space navigation is JPL&#x19;s AutoNav software that, currently, only processes optical data. The addition of radiometric data processing will be new. The closest analog is NASA GSFC GEONS and JPL&#x19;s Real Time GIPSY software; however, these rely on GPS data and typically require a minimal set of GPS satellites to be in view in order to produce viable navigation solutions. These systems target orbital operations in the vicinity of Earth, and are not readily extensible to deep space operations. AutoNav is uniquely suited for processing radio data as it has been built around the deep space navigation paradigm.",

      "description": "The SCaN Testbed is an experimental communication system that is located on the truss of the International Space Station (ISS). The technology has over 3000 hours of operations since launch in 2012, and is paving the way for infusion of SDRs and associated communications, navigation, and networking software applications into the SCaN integrated network. The project is led by the Glenn Research Center (GRC), and includes experiment activities by GRC, Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Goddard Space Flight Center, Johnson Space Center, industry, academia, and international space agencies. Experimenters develop software for the Testbed&#x19;s S- and Ka-Band radios and communicate through the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System (TDRSS) or direct to a ground station. SCaN Testbed is the first NASA mission to support full-duplex space-to-space Ka-band communication, making it an ideal evaluation platform for missions considering the higher bandwidth and data rates that Ka-band can provide. The SCaN Testbed is an experimental communication system that is located on the truss of the International Space Station (ISS). The SCaN Testbed has been infused into the SCaN Program, which is a part of NASA&#x19;s Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate. The SCaN Testbed project has developed and enabled the infusion of multiple new software applications since launch that enhance the communications, navigation, and networking performance of the system. These applications are compliant with NASA&#x19;s Space Telecommunications Radio System (STRS) architecture standard, which means they are easily portable to other STRS-compliant commercial radios. New communications applications (waveforms) include a high-rate, bandwidth-efficient transmit waveform, capable of 1 Gbps data rate with NASA&#x19;s low density parity check (LDPC) encoding. A Global Positioning System (GPS) waveform expanded the Testbed&#x19;s capabilities to achieve the first in-space reception of the newest GPS frequency (L5-1176.45 MHz) and checkout of the Civilian Navigation Message (CNAV) data on behalf of the United States Air Force. Software developed for the avionics processor has not only enabled on-board routing among the three SDRs, but also enabled international interoperable disruption tolerant networking (DTN) tests with the French space agency, CNES. Currently, SCaN Testbed experimenters are implementing adaptive and cognitive radio applications that will improve operational efficiency, enhance data return, and mitigate the effects of interference on radio performance. Understanding the development, verification, and operations of SDRs is critical to reduce risk and cost to future missions as SDRs emerge as the radio technology of the future. The International Space Station provides an ideal operations platform to verify SCaN Testbed technologies by enabling daily, on-orbit reconfiguration of the SDRs between existing and new software applications. The SCaN Testbed has advanced the technology readiness level (TRL) of SDRs from 4 to 8. SCaN Testbed technologies earned three prestigious awards in 2013 including a Research &amp; Development (R&amp;D) 100 award for the first Ka-band transceiver, Wireless Innovation Forum Technology of the Year runner up for a breakthrough product or technology in the field of Software Defined or Cognitive Radio, and ISS Top Technology for Exploration. Experimenters from around the Agency, small businesses, and universities create a broad base of SDR platform and application experts across the nation. Working together, these experts will develop the communications systems of the future. SCaN Testbed continues to be recognized for the contributions it is making to enhance NASA&#x19;s space communications capability. SCaN Testbed was decommissioned in May 2019, following nearly 7 years of successful operations in space. The payload was removed from ISS on May 11, 2019 using the robotic arm and placed in the trunk of the SpaceX CRS-17 vehicle. The trunk and SCaN Testbed then burned up in Earth&#x27;s atmosphere on June 3, 2019 during controlled re-entry.",

      "description": "The Unmanned Aerial System (UAS) industry in the United States is still very much in its infancy, but its potential impacts on the geospatial mapping and surveying professions are indisputable. In future years, requirements for imaging and remote-sensing observations with semi-autonomous operations Unmanned Autonomous Vehicle (UAV) will be key requirements for surveys of other planetary atmospheres and surfaces. In anticipation of these requirements, it is imperative that new technologies with increased automation capability, speed, and accuracy that can be achieved during a single mission are developed, evaluated and implemented. For this project, a prototype autonomous rover system that provides a framework to collect planetary remotely sensed data and leverage cloud computing services to produce environmental mapping products with that data, was developed and tested. This innovative technology could potentially support a wide variety of planetary data gathering science missions, while at the same time, offer the flexibility to incorporate additional new techniques that could eventually be applied to swarm rovers that integrate planetary aerial and surface access systems. Additionally, this technology could potentially be used to address SSC related facility monitoring and security issues; such as buffer zone intrusions, and provide support for rapid response capability for both natural and manmade disasters. In military operations, large remotely piloted UAVs have been successfully deployed for several years. The success in this application has spawned a new area of research - micro-autonomous aerial vehicles (micro-AAVs). Over the past two years, this research area has been exploited by universities, and has resulted in a rich collection of micro-AAVs platforms which range from the small, open-platform system using open source waypoint navigation software; to small, production ready, commercial-off-the-shelf platforms with complex highly intelligent flight management systems. These platforms are capable of supporting a full array of sensors and cameras ranging from high-resolution, true-color, still images to high-resolution real-time video streams. In addition, some platforms are capable of supporting near infrared (NIR) cameras that can be used for Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) data products useful for vegetation health monitoring similar to those generated today by our team using Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite data. Additionally, for over a decade now, rovers have been successfully used on Mars to collect terrestrial close-up imagery and other sensor data. For future lunar and planetary exploratory missions, the development of smaller and more efficient micro-rover platforms have been proposed, and have been prototyped in a variety of forms and locomotive means. For successful and safe exploration of these surfaces, ultra-high resolution terrain and feature data, as well as, a flexible autonomous system to gather and process this data over wide areas will be required. For this project, the potential of simulating a rover-balloon tethered system, autonomous cloud enabled system, for gathering and processing low altitude high resolution imagery for the purposes of terrain model and thematic data product creation was explored, and demonstrated. The tablet cameras and sensors were used as a proxy for the AAV sensor and image data. A typical limiting factor associated with the small payload of these systems (micro-AAVs) is the computational power that can be deployed on them, which, correspondingly, limits their autonomous capabilities. To increase computational capacity, data was pushed to a cloud location for access by the processing system. Therefore, this project explored using cloud computing to increase its computational capacity on a tablet. The tablet and commercial off the shelf (COTS) smartphone with camera was able to establish communication with the cloud by tethering to a tablet mobile Wi-Fi hotspot for internet access. The tablet allowed for real-time data processing, analysis, and autonomous flight operations based on those observations. Therefore, for this project, the effective computational power of these platforms was increased by simulating cloud computing services via a local virtual machine data processing system. Using this Virtual Machine to establish communication with the cloud, the computational capacity of the simulated micro-AAV was augmented and enabled real-time data processing and analysis based on those observations. Future testing of this data processing flow via a virtual machine could be directly translated to current cloud computing services with little modification, and once implemented could enhance available UAV aerial rapid response platforms capabilities in their ability to respond to natural or manmade disasters.",

      "description": "Extending some recent developments in the area of technical consensus standards for cryogenic thermal insulation systems, a preliminary Inter-Laboratory Study of foam insulation materials was performed by NASA Kennedy Space Center and LeTourneau University. The initial focus was ambient pressure cryogenic boil off testing using the Cryostat-400 flat-plate instrument. Completion of a test facility at LETU has enabled direct, comparative testing, using identical cryostat instruments and methods, and the production of standard thermal data sets for a number of materials under sub-ambient conditions. The two sets of measurements were analyzed and indicate there is reasonable agreement between the two laboratories.Based on cryogenic boiloff calorimetry, new equipment and methods for testing thermal insulation systems have been successfully developed. These boiloff instruments (or cryostats) include both flat plate and cylindrical models and are applicable to a wide range of different materials under a wide range of test conditions. Test measurements are generally made at large temperature difference (boundary temperatures of 293 K and 78 K are typical) and include the full vacuum pressure range. Results are generally reported in effective thermal conductivity (ke) and mean heat flux (q) through the insulation system. The new cryostat instruments provide an effective and reliable way to characterize the thermal performance of materials under sub-ambient conditions. Proven in through thousands of tests of hundreds of material systems, they have supported a wide range of aerospace, industry, and research projects. Boiloff testing technology is not just for cryogenic testing but is a cost-effective, field-representative methodology to test any material or system for applications at sub-ambient temperatures. This technology, when adequately coupled with a technical standards basis, can provide a cost-effective, field-representative methodology to test any material or system for applications at sub-ambient to cryogenic temperatures. A growing need for energy efficiency and cryogenic applications is creating a worldwide demand for improved thermal insulation systems for low temperatures. The need for thermal characterization of these systems and materials raises a corresponding need for insulation test standards and thermal data targeted for cryogenic-vacuum applications. Such standards have a strong correlation to energy, transportation, and environment and the advancement of new materials technologies in these areas. In conjunction with this project, two new standards on cryogenic insulation were recently published by ASTM International: C1774 and C740. Following the requirements of NPR 7120.10, Technical Standards for NASA Programs and Projects, the appropriate information in this report can be provided to the NASA Chief Engineer as input for NASA&#x27;s annual report to NIST, as required by OMB Circular No. A-119, describing NASA&#x27;s use of voluntary consensus standards and participation in the development of voluntary consensus standards and bodies. Although some standards exist for thermal insulation, few address the sub-ambient temperature range and cold-side temperatures below 100 K. Standards for cryogenic insulation systems require cryostat testing and data analysis that will allow the development of the tools needed by design engineers and thermal analysts for the design of practical cryogenic systems. Thus, this critically important information can provide reliable data and methodologies for industrial efficiency and energy conservation. The needs for technical standards for thermal insulation systems are growing in the US and worldwide. Energy efficiency and conservation needs -- of which thermal insulation systems are a key part -- are a top priority for economic, national security, and technological concerns. The emphasis on technical consensus standards is a clear directive from both government policy and market economic drivers. Summarized here are the most recent and relevant government policy directives to encourage technical standards development and energy efficiency technology implementation. The reference federal agency is NASA and the target subject area is thermal insulation systems for low-temperature applications. Here is a list of the relevant documents: OMB Circular No. A-119, Federal Participation in the Development and Use of Voluntary Consensus Standards and in Conformity Assessment Activities. Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies, document M-12-08 dated January 17, 2012. NPR 7120.10, Technical Standards for NASA Programs and Projects, Effective Date: April 22, 2011. On February 4, 2011, the President released A Strategy for American Innovation: Securing Our Economic Growth and Prosperity and directed Federal agencies to increase their efforts to catalyze technology breakthroughs to advance national priorities. Pursuant to the Strategy for American Innovation, the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), and the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) are the Memorandum for the Heads of Executive Departments and Agencies was issued to clarify principles guiding Federal Government engagement in standards activities that can help address national priorities. This R&amp;D project was formulated in response to these agency and national objectives for technical standards. A preliminary Inter-Laboratory Study of foam insulation materials was conducted by NASA Kennedy Space Center (KSC) and LeTourneau University (LETU). The initial focus was ambient pressure (no vacuum) cryogenic boil off testing using two identical Cryostat-400 flat-plate instruments. Completion of a new test facility at LETU has enabled comparative testing, using similar methods, and the production of standard thermal data sets for cellular glass insulation material under cryogenic conditions. Test measurements were made at both KSC and LETU for comparative analysis. The results show reasonable agreement between the two laboratories. These initial measurements were made at the approximate boundary temperatures of 293 K and 78 K, the results of which are reported in comparative effective thermal conductivity (comparative ke) and mean heat flux (q). The main challenge is the production of standardized thermal data sets for cryogenic insulation materials and systems. This project took up the challenge and made progress in three ways. The first was to produce a cataloged set of reference test specimens of cellular glass material. Other materials have been identified for future reference test specimens. Second was to conduct a preliminary interlaboratory study of the cellular glass material using the same equipment and methods (Cryostat-400 instrument). The third way was to show the practicality of using boiloff calorimetry to obtain thermal data for stack-ups of different materials (composite panels and insulation materials alike). The boiloff method, being a direct measure of heat energy, provides effective test solutions where other existing commercial methods fall short or are not possible. In conjunction with this project, two new standards on cryogenic insulation were recently published by ASTM International: C1774 and C740. Following the requirements of NPR 7120.10, Technical Standards for NASA Programs and Projects, the appropriate information in this report can be provided to the NASA Chief Engineer as input for NASA&#x27;s annual report to NIST, as required by OMB Circular No. A-119, describing NASA&#x27;s use of voluntary consensus standards and participation in the development of voluntary consensus standards and bodies. Further standards in the area of cryogenic insulation systems have been targeted for future development. This project involved a number of tasks that were synergetic with other projects under Advanced Exploration Systems, Center Innovation Fund, Game Changing Technology, and others. Compliance issues associated with PVS systems requirements was a major hit on resources in 2013 thus making this leveraging among projects crucial for this work. Three New Technology Reports, three peer-reviewed publications, and one full patent application were also produced in conjunction with this project. Additonal publications and patents are pending.",

The primary science goal of lunar habitat is to investigate germination and initial plant growth when subject to the combined effects of lunar gravity and lunar surface radiation. The LPX module has been designed to be a flexible base unit that can be adapted to fly to the lunar surface on a variety of landers and rovers. LPX has size and shape of a 1U CubeSat (10 cm on a side) and a total mass of 0.3 kg. The base will contain a seed module holding around 50 Arabidopsis seeds and provide ~ 0.5 liter of normal air at standard pressure. By the action of a small pump, water will be released after landing to initiate germination. Images will document the germination, initial growth, phototropism, and circumnutation of the small plants while sunlight remains available. A CO2 sensor tracks the release of CO2 during germination and the subsequent uptake of CO2 by photosynthesis. Simulations indicate that the CO2 peak level will be an increase by 2250 ppm after 2 earth-days and then decline to about 1000 ppm after 7 earth-days. The camera and CO2 sensor interfaces are USB.

To provide for optimum growth, light levels in the plant growth stage need to be between 75 and 150 umole m-2 s-1 in the 400 to 700 nm interval. Background: The importance of plants for long-term life support in human bases on Moon and Mars has long been understood and is of continuing interest. However, there are very little data to show how plants will grow in the partial gravity and high radiation on the surface of the Moon or Mars. The vast literature on the growth of plants on the surface of the Earth has been augmented by a growing literature on plant growth in microgravity. How biology responds to partial gravity remains uncertain. It has been implicitly assumed by the mission planners who have been designing long-term human missions to the Moon and Mars that biological development and response to 1/3 and 1/6 gravity will be more akin to 1 g than to microgravity. Only recently have studies with small centrifuges on ISS allowed for investigations at partial gravity begun to test this assumption. Major goals: The plant science goal for LPX is to demonstrate germination and initial growth in lunar gravity and radiation. The technical goal for LPX is to design a 1U habitat that can provide Earth normal atmosphere, sunlight, and water on the surface of the Moon to support a variety of life sciences experiments. The expected LPX science results can be listed, in the following priority order, as: Germination in lunar gravity and radiation Rate of growth (leaf area index) versus time Observation of circumnuation Observation of phototropism CO2 release during germination and subsequent uptake by photosynthesis. Figure 1 shows an image of the plant growth stage with Arabidopsis sprouts after 7 days of grown. Image was taken with the camera in the LPX mockup. Figure 1. Arabidopsis after 7 days of growth in a sealed chamber. Maximum height is 1.2 cm. Figure 2 shows data from the growth of 150 seeds of Arabidopsis in a sealed 1.3 liter container. We estimate that approximately 50% of the organic C in the seeds was released during germination resulting in the increase of 2250 ppm CO2.) Figure 2. CO2 over time for 150 seeds in a 1.3 liter closed volume. Habitat Design and Operation: We present a preliminary design for the LPX module. The LPX habitat is designed to have minimal impact on the mission design, spacecraft, and lander operations. The design is open and represents an initial engineering design by NASA published in order to allow researchers and university students to modify it to meet their own science/engineering experimental goals. Improvements and augmentations to the basic NASA design will be collected and posted for open sharing. The habitat is a made out of aluminum with a lexan / polysulfone window on the top. The habitat on the inside contains the seed module to hold seeds mounted on Whatman filter paper using guar gum, the water storage and pump delivery system, camera, CO2 sensor, and an electrical pass through. All the power, operations and data on the habitat will be controlled by the lander where a cable using suitable interface to attach the habitat and spacecraft will be used (based on the power, data interface requirement of the spacecraft).

Figure 3. The 1U CubeSat LPX habitat showing the camera, CO2 sensor, water delivery system, and plant growth stage. In this design there is a window in the top to allow sunlight to enter. Right panel shows a 3D model of the components suitable for 3D printing /machining. Seeds and seed growth platform: The primary plant used in our habitat is Arabidopsis, used widely in plant physiology experiments on ISS. The seeds will be carried in the seed module at the bottom of the habitat. The module is made from ABS/ Delrin, an insulating and biocompatible material, to help stabilize the temperature of the seeds. There are furrows in the polymer, lined with erect blotter paper and polypropylene combs inserted in rows spaced 0.5 cm apart. This design is similar to shuttle and ISS-heritage plant experiments. The comb provides air to the root system and ensures plants are adequately spaced for science imaging. Over 50 seeds can be accommodated in the LPX habitat. Over the 8 days of the nominal mission it is expected that the plants will reach a height of ~1 cm -1.5 cm. This sets the depth of focus required for the camera. Camera: The camera system is a small, high resolution web cam. These are commercially available units. Our basic design is based on a 180 degree fish-eye camera. The 180 degree lens causes geometric distortion of the image but this distortion can be easily corrected with image processing software. This type of lens allows not only to capture the root module but also look at the sides of the habitat where the water reservoir, pump and CO2 sensor are located. It also allows a depth of focus sufficient to image Arabidopsis shoot growth up to 2 cm. The camera is located directly above the growth stage to look down on the plants providing the best view for determining the plant leaf area. The roots are not imaged in the current system. From these images we will be able to determine that germination has occurred, track the leaf area over time and track the position and orientation of individual plants. Ideally, the images will be obtained at a rate of one per six hours after water is added. However, to document circumnutation, it would be preferable to collect images at 5 minute intervals for at least 6 hours on one of the days (day 5,6, 7). Because the plants grow and move slowly, image compression can greatly reduce the total data volume that must be downloaded to Earth. The images from the camera also are used to determine the water state of the seed platform by use of small disks that change color when wetted. Water pump, reservoir bag, &amp; colorimetric water sensors: The water delivery system depends on pump pressure and capillary action to wet all seed module furrows. It consists of a water bag made of biocompatible material and a pump that serves as a valve until it is activated. Once activated it then pumps the water through a tube to a reservoir under the seed module that is packed with blotter paper with a layer of gauze cloth (cheese cloth). The absorbent paper wicks the moisture across the bottom of all seed furrows, which are also filled with blotter paper. The freeze-tolerant water bag has flown in space on NASA - Roscosmos BION experiment (Bion is a 14-30 day Russian LEO biological experiments capsule). The current intended pump is a piezo electric micro pump. During the experiment colorimetric wetness indicators will show the extent to which water has wetted the seed module. This material turns red when exposed to liquid water and provides a way to use our images to confirm water delivery. This indicator tape has been tested for biocompatibility, freeze-thermal and vibration adhesion. Small disks that change color when wetted are placed in several locations on the plant growth stage. Passive pressure indicator: We will use a small piece of biocompatible plastic bubble wrap as a passive pressure indicator to detect total loss of pressure due to a leak. Container and seals: The habitat can be made of standard aerospace grade Aluminum alloy T6061 for good thermal control. The habitat can also be 3D printed using aluminum powder or be made out of coated polysulphone /lexan. The lid of the container could be made of aluminum or a clear lexan panel or a combination of both- basically a lexan window in an aluminum lid. For the current design the habitat will be machined from an aluminum block with a lid and window top. Seals (O rings) used will be of the same material and tolerances as those used on similar previous experiments flown in space. An electrical pass-through will allow the lander to communicate with the habitat, initiating the sensor suite, and download imaging data. The final electrical pass-through would be selected based on the spacecraft interface requirements. Payload/Instrument Integration/Accommodation/Location Requirements: There are a few outline requirements to accommodate the payload with the lander. First, the habitat interior should be maintained between 22&#xba;C and 27&#xba;C and must not reach temperatures much over 27&#xba;C during the lunar day. Secondly, the habitat must be electrically connected to the lander computer for control and data transfer. Thirdly, the habitat should be placed such that is can receive natural sunlight (exposing the top window). There are two possible mounting locations: 1) On an external surface which will provide the best exposure; 2) Inside the lander and exposing the top window to sunlight. An alternative to use of sunlight might be inclusion of internal LEDs to provide sufficient light for germination and seedling growth. Use of internal LEDs provides sufficient lighting to insure experiment success, regardless of habitat position or window exposure to sunlight. Payload Operations: Following is the sequence of operation for the habitat. The habitat can be assembled and seeds put in place a month or more before the flight (preferably &#x13; as close as possible to flight date). Once mounted the seeds stay dry and dormant during launch and flight to the surface of the moon. During this period the habitat does not require any power or data stream from the spacecraft. The seeds can survive temperature excursions from -160&#xba; to 55&#xba;C. Once on the surface on moon with lander ready to start experiments, this experiment will be initiated by obtaining a baseline CO2 reading, a reference image, and then activating the water pump to initiate germination. CO2 readings and images are then obtained as often as the data system can be accommodated, ideally once every 6 hours as described above. The CO2 reading and camera images are stored on board the spacecraft until offloaded by the computer. All data is downlinked to Earth for analysis by the Science Team (It is not anticipated that the team will send commands to the habitat). In-Flight Calibration and Testing: There are no inflight calibration and testing requirements. Data Plan: All raw data, calibration records, and processed data from LPX will be maintained in an updated form throughout the period of investigation. A continually updated record of the &quot;best version&quot; of the data will be maintained until meaningful changes in data calibration no longer occur. Data Reduction and Validation: All images and data will be released to the public as they are downloaded and calibrated (within 24 hours). All data will be placed in the Planetary Data system within 30 days of data download. The final archival data will be stored in the Planetary Data System (PDS) within 90 days after download. Images will be processed by the Science Team and plant height and leaf area will be determined on ground. The imaging sequences for growth, development, phototropism and circumnutation will be assembled into videos showing these characteristic plant motions. A publication of these results will be submitted within 90 days of complete data download. Performance Margins: The key performance requirement is on the camera. The baseline camera design use has a performance margin of at least a factor of 2. This means that the resolution of the images is 2 times the resolution needed for our science goals. This margin is maintained in the event of data bit dropout due to radiation effects. CO2 sensor: The CO2 sensor is a commercially available unit that is small, USB operated, and reads over a range of CO2 from 0 to 10,000 ppm &#xb1;50 ppm. Minimal Data: One quality image at day 5-8 is adequate to confirm if germination and early growth occurred. The record of CO2 provides an independent indication of germination and photosynthesis. Preferred Data: Color images of the plant growth area and CO2 readings every 6 hrs (or less) for the full duration following hydration. If not possible, then one image per day following hydration (to verify hydration event) followed by images every 6 hrs commencing with day 3. Data plan rationale: Minimal image data confirms that environmental conditions were sufficient for germination and early growth, resulting in photosynthetic tissues capable of generating O2. The preferred data provide for assessment of detailed plant growth including rates of germination and growth. Six-hour frequency of daytime images will demonstrate phototropism as the angle of incident light changes through the lunar day. A burst of images taken at 5 minute intervals, taken on approximately day 7 in late afternoon, for approximately 4-6 hours to document circumnutation. Images can be recorded and downlinked later as bandwidth permits. Detection of all of these earth-normal growth parameters will allow for detailed comparison of plant performance under earth conditions. Instrument Test and Verifications Plan: The standard collection of tests performed on flight instruments will be applied to the LPX habitat: thermal, vacuum, shock and vibration, extreme temperatures, etc. One test specific to life sciences experiments is extended biocompatibility tests of all habitat material to simulate the longest launch preparation, lunar transit stage, and landed mission (approximately 2 months). Earth-based and ISS controls: The scientific results of LPX must be compared to Earth-based controls and ISS microgravity, and partial gravity experiments. The 1U CubeSat design allows for easy replication by students and researchers on Earth and for accommodation on ISS. Additional sensors: The basic LPX has only a CO2 sensor and a camera. However additional sensors could be considered in variants or future designs. These include: External temperature Ionizing radiation Internal temperature Internal light level, intensity and spectrum Internal RH Pressure O2 partial pressure Ethylene absorbent Thermal Control: A key requirement for the success of LPX is temperature control. The range of temperature in the habitat after initiation of growth must be between 22&#xba;C and 27&#xba;C - a much narrower range of temperature than typical for flight electronics or flight instruments. This poses significant challenges. The general approach that is to design the LPX surface coatings and position on the lander such that the equilibrium temperature is ~20&#xba;C and then to add a small root module heater to bring the temperature up to desired range. The design of reflective and heat emitting surfaces and their coupling to the LPX module will depend on the landing latitude of mission. For missions equatorward of 45&#xba; the challenge will likely be keeping the habitat cool. For missions which land poleward of 45&#xba;, the challenge will likely be keeping the habitat warm. A significant variable in this problem is the extent to which the habitat is warmed by the lunar surface and light reflected from the spacecraft surfaces. This aspect of the LPX design will require considerable work specific to the mission architecture and the chosen landing site and hence can only be done after these are specified. Inclusion of an internal thermocouple and root module feedback-controlled heater greatly reduces reliance on external surfaces to maintain a biologically appropriate internal temperature.",

      "description": "The objective of this research is to understand human-space suit interaction and design hardware to assess and mitigate injury and discomfort inside the space suit. This will be achieved through the following specific aims. 1.1.1 Specific Aim 1: Analyze data for correlations between anthropometry, space suit components, and injury. Shoulder injuries are some of the most serious and debilitating injuries associated with EVA (extravehicular activity) training. Using a database compiled by NASA personnel on subject anthropometry, training time in different space suit components, and reported shoulder incidents, the following hypotheses will be evaluated: Hypothesis 1: Anthropometric dimensions will be a predictive factor in identifying astronauts with a reported shoulder incident. Hypothesis 2: Suit training variables in the planar hard upper torso (HUT), rather than training in the pivoted HUT, will be a predictive factor in identifying astronauts with a reported shoulder incident. Suit training variables are defined by aggregating training information, such number of or percentage of training incidences in the planar or pivoted HUT. Hypothesis 3: Operational training variables will be a predictive factor in identifying astronauts with a reported shoulder incident. Operational training variables are defined by aggregating training information, such as frequency of training, accumulation of days between training incidences, or career duration of active duty training. Hypothesis 4: Record of previous injury will be a predictive factor in identifying astronauts with an additional shoulder incident. Each of these hypotheses investigates a specific causal mechanism found in the literature associated with EVA shoulder injuries and relates it to a reported shoulder incident. Hypothesis 4 will only be evaluated for those subjects with injury incidents directly attributable to the space suit. 1.1.2 Specific Aim 2: Quantify and evaluate human-space suit interaction with a suite of sensors. There is currently no method by which to measure how the person moves inside the space suit. Focusing on the upper body, a pressure sensing tool will be created to quantify human-space suit interaction under different loading regimes. Additionally, a commercially purchased pressure sensing tool will be used over the shoulder under the space suit Hard Upper Torso (HUT). Finally, inertial measurement units (IMUs) will be used to measure and assess kinematics both of the suit and the person inside. The following design requirements will be evaluated to determine the success or failure in designing a wearable pressure sensing garment for the space suit environment: Design Requirement 1: A pressure sensing tool will achieve both high wearability and high utility in a space suit environment. Wearability is defined by mobility, comfort, and safety of the user. Utility is defined by range, accuracy, resolution, and coverage of the sensor system. Design Requirement 2: Human and space suit interaction characterized by interface pressures will show trends consistent with expected loading regimes. Trends are defined by sensor pressure profiles over isolated or functional tasks. Expected loading regimes are defined by subjective feedback or inferred loading based on anticipated contact. Design Requirement 1 evaluates the performance of the pressure sensing system to ensure it is properly scoped for its intended use. Design Requirement 2 investigates the system&#x19;s ability to function properly in the environment of the space suit so its results may be interpreted with confidence. The pressure sensing tool will be used to evaluate human-space suit interaction to assess consistency of movement. Consistency of movement is an important metric revealing fatigue or changes in biomechanical strategies, both of which could be precursors to EVA injury. The following hypothesis will be evaluated in a human subject experiment inside the space suit: Hypothesis 5: Subjects with experience working in the space suit will perform motion tasks with consistent movement strategies. Movement strategies are defined by peak pressures averaged over trials or full time averaged pressure profiles. The commercially purchased pressure sensing tool that is placed at the interface between the shoulder and the Hard Upper Torso will be used to quantify and analyze the pressure distributions and profiles that arise in this region, thus developing a biomechanical understanding of the potential for shoulder injury in pressurized suits. A human subject experiment was performed inside the space suit to evaluate motions and regions that are particularly prone to injury. We determine subject-specific anthropometric regions of concern by considering pressure distributions, frequency of loading, and regional pressure responses. Subject consistency is also evaluated through statistical analysis of the peak pressures. Hypothesis 6: Subjects perform motion tasks in a consistent manner as measured by pressure values over the shoulder. The kinematic sensors (IMUs) will be used to evaluate human-space suit interaction between body motions and suit motions. Externally measureable suit kinematics may not reflect the human body&#x19;s motions inside the suit due to complex design involving non planar bearing or convolutes and pressurization. The following hypothesis will be evaluated in a human subject experiment inside the space suit: Hypothesis 7: Body and suit joint angle amplitude differ significantly in amplitude for upper body motions. Hypothesis 8: Body and suit joint angle differ significantly in axis of rotation for upper body motions. The purpose of Hypotheses 6 and 7 are to evaluate differences in suited motion between the person and the space suit. Additionally, we seek to evaluate the impairment of mobility for upper body joints in different suits, using IMUs, as compared to baseline range of motion. The following hypothesis will be evaluated in a human subject experiment inside the space suit: Hypothesis 9: Space suit pressurization significantly impairs the joint angle amplitude of upper body motions. 1.1.3 Specific Aim 3: Model human-space suit interaction. The purpose of SA3 is to gain a better understanding of the EVA injury mechanisms, particularly strain injuries caused by the Extravehicular Mobility Unit (EMU). The objective is to determine the extent to which muscle activity is affected by the presence of the highly-pressurized space suit. A musculoskeletal human-space suit interaction model is developed in order to quantify musculoskeletal performance of astronauts during Extravehicular Activity, and to assess their injury susceptibility. 1.1.4 Specific Aim 4: Design and Develop modular protective devices. Our work develops conceptual solutions to mitigate injury. As part of this effort, we identify promising materials and build prototype protective devices. We aim to alleviate injury prone areas and improve the person&#x19;s comfort within the suit. Protective devices will be integrated to the protective garments and can be personalized for each crewmember.",
