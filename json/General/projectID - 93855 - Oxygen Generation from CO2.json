    "description": "Pursue molecular- and nano-based catalysts to attach and activate CO2 molecules to release dioxygen (O2) after the application of external energy. Our approach seeks to prove that molecular catalysis with electrochemistry is more efficient than high temperature to generate O2.",
    "benefits": "Generating O2 from CO2 under benign conditions could provide next generation technology for in situ resource utilization in potential manned missions on Mars, ISS, and other planetary environments. The system in this work could potentially be leveraged to produce fuels, fertilizers, or other species for ISRU applications. The CO2 conversion to O2 technology could provide an effective approach to recycle CO2 from the terrestrial atmosphere and offers great promise for climate control.  The system shows promise and is currently at TRL 2.",

    "closeoutSummary": "The approach taken is to use a two-step process. First produce water from CO2 then produce oygen from water.  Step 1 water production was confirmed by proton nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and Karl Fischer measurements. Yield was ~100% with 1 molecule of water produced for every CO2 molecule consumed with a projected production rate: 30 nmole/s \\xe0 90 g H2O/hour for 1 g catalyst (a rough estimate based on NMR spectrum assuming 20 ug catalyst used). Step 2, oxygen from water was also successful with 100% confersion.  These are lab experiments under idealized conditions, but the results are very promising.   ",
